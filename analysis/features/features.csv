For those of you who haven't heard of us, we launched our sunglasses brand Tens a few years back with the simple idea that sunglasses shouldn't make things look more dull, they should make things look better. We took our favourite method of warming up our photos in Photoshop, and applied it to a sunglass lens (which still protects your eyes from 100% of harmful UV rays)

The highlights:

 ? We've just launched our 2018 collection - sunglasses with biodegradable frames made from plants! In partnership with Italy's finest acetate manufacturer Mazzucchelli, the frame is created using cotton and wood pulp from sustainably managed forests.

? We have a whole new super hot website! - https://tens.co

? We spent a ton of time redefining how we pitch our brand and it's personality, I hope that comes across.

? We made a really fun new video.

? We've internationalised our website too, with individual UK, EU and US sites for now buttt we have translated country specific stores launching in the next month for a number of countries throughout EU and Asia, with local currency and fulfilment.

As someone who is obsessed with ideas ? and inventions you realise quickly that the best ideas nearly always stem from a real problem ?. Especially ideas that are turned in to successful businesses ???.

Looking at a single problem can help generate dozens of ideas or solutions to that problem. Therefore, I believe that in order to ideate successfully you should start by looking at problems.

The point of this project is to list one problem a day, sourced directly from a user on Twitter. No matter how big or small these problems may seem, they can inevitably lead to larger ideas in their respective solutions.

I hope you like it!
@angeliquesocial Hi Angie, thanks for you comment and I hope that it can serve that purpose to anyone looking where to start. I am lucky to have found something that I enjoy doing and in the field that inspires me most (startups and entrepreneurship). 

People tend to use specific sentence structure and wording when conveying a problem they are facing. I call these ‚Äútrigger sentences‚Äù. An example of a trigger sentence is one that you already mentioned, ""I wish someone would invent"".

I hope that you continue to visit and find inspiration from the problems ?

Thanks a lot for checking it out! 

First of all, yes! Offline-mode is on the roadmap.  And you can expect this very soon! ?? There are a few reasons why this is actually more tricky than it seems, and why it's taking some time and I'll explain this in depth below. 

Before getting into details, in general I'd say that Cryptee is a great alternative if you're already using and trusting Evernote / Bearnote / Google Docs / Google Photos or alikes with your critical personal information, and it's meant as a better and safer alternative to un-encrypted services. ?

Regarding your concerns, I'll split up and address them in multiple parts, since I can absolutely relate to them myself.

To begin with, all your data is encrypted on your device, before leaving your device. It's AES256 which is a DOD-grade encryption. This means that if you were to look at the servers, all you'd would find is simply gibberish/encrypted text. And you can verify this and the encryption by checking the source code. ?

In addition, even if you don't trust the encryption itself for reasons I'd be curious to hear, there's actually a lot of downsides of keeping important information on your devices locally per se, and here are four/five most important ones.

1a) While entering U.S. they can ask you to unlock and decrypt your devices, and failure to do so could result in denial to enter the country. The numbers are consistently rising. https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 ?

1b) There are reports of Chinese government installing spyware on visitors' phones at the border. Latest I could find is from reddit from a couple days ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/8ofiiw/chinese_border_police_installed_software_on_my/ ?

Cryptee has a special feature called Ghost Folders to fight against these types of situations , which allows you to hide those folders, and only be able to retrieve back if you know their titles. When you Ghost a folder it's removed from your account, and your encrypted data is put in a separate air gapped database for additional security. 

2) If your device is infected with malware, your important information can be stolen or gone overnight. ?

3) On the less tin-foil hat side, if you happen to spill coffee on your device, your critical data would be lost, and you can protect yourself from this with pretty much all things cloud-based. ‚òïÔ∏è

4) And finally, in defense of all things cloud-based, you can access your data on all your devices. Local storage unfortunately wouldn't allow this. Sync'ing over bluetooth or local networks is a pretty neat idea! I'll take a look into this! ‚úå?

--

I'll absolutely understand if your personal threat-model isn't oppressive governments, or if you're already a privacy-aware person who doesn't use any cloud / sync'ed services at all. ??
But considering how internet is a big part of our lives, and that we access to information using multiple devices now, I think it's crucial that Cryptee works both online and offline, and I respectfully disagree that ""uploading"" is a deal breaker for the reasons I mentioned above ‚úå?

Give it a try and let me know what you think! ?
And Happy Sunday! ‚òÄÔ∏è
@nicole_henry Thank you so much Nicole! Haha I'm pretty sure they would try hacking even without the name of choice! ?

The beauty of a zero-knowledge encrypted system is that, even if some day, somehow, a hacker manages to hack the servers, all they would find is fully encrypted files, which would be impossible for them to crack without your keys ??

And I've built some pretty fun honeypots and organic alert systems to detect any malicious activity before it even starts to happen  ?
@dionisloire Hey Dionis! Thanks a lot for checking it out, and many thanks for the kind words! 

There's indeed many different angles to consider! I think the most important being good UX, good communication with users and design. If you think about it, there's already a ton of different individual security and encryption tools out there, but they either don't work in harmony, or are too complicated with the barrier to entry being too high for most people. So in a way this is what I'm trying to accomplish with Cryptee. Help users make informed security decisions. ?

Regarding sharing, this is already in the works. This is perhaps the most complicated feature in terms of security, and getting it right will take some time. ?

Chances are it will have multiple stages of rollout, and at first it won't be real-time collaboration like Google Docs. Instead it will first work in a way that say for example: 

You will click ""share file"", then create a new encryption key for that specific file, and Cryptee will generate you a share URL. You will then share this URL and the encryption key you picked for that file with the person you wish to share your document / photo album with. And they will be able to click that URL, type the key and check out the file. ?

I hope this makes sense. Really looking forward to this feature myself too! ‚úå? 
Hope you're having a great weekend so far!
@nicole_henry @exlemor Hello Emmanuel,

I think it's worth clarifying some terminology here, and I'll bring some math to the table to demonstrate what I mean. 

First, ""cracking AES256"" means cracking ""one key"" and not something that grants someone a golden key to decrypt everything that is AES256. ?

So how long does it take exactly, to crack AES256 with a supercomputer like the ones you've linked? 

Say we use something that has 33.86 petaflops (quadrillion flops) of processing power. This would be conveniently #4 on the list you've just sent. ??

A 33.86 petaflop supercomputer would be able to try to crack : 
33 860 000 000 000 000 keys per second (33.86 quadrilion = 3.386e16)
Then let's multiply this to find the number of keys it can try in one year: 
3.386e16 * 31556952 seconds in a year.
= 1.0685184e24 keys per year (~1 septillion, 1 yottaflop)

Since we're talking AES256 = it has 2^255 possible keys.
2^255 / 1.0685184e24  = 5.4183479e52 years

And that's just for one supercomputer. 

Reducing the time by just one power would require 10 more basketball court-sized supercomputers. To reduce the time by x power, we would require 10x basketball court-sized supercomputers. So you would need 10^38 supercomputers, with a computing power between #3 and #4 on your list, and these 10^38 supercomputers would have to run for the entirety of their existence of everything to exhaust only HALF of the keyspace of, ONE, SINGLE, AES256 key. 

So if you are concerned that a government could potentially dedicate that much supercomputer power to crack JUST YOUR KEY, in your lifetime, (again, not all keys, just one), then I think you have bigger problems than Cryptee's security to worry about. 

--- 

Let's talk about Quantum Computing since you mentioned. 
As it stands today, the best known theoretical attack against AES256 is Grover's quantum search algorithm. And that only cracks things a square root of key size faster. And to make this happen you'd need a quantum computer, with 256 qubit register. (and again, running for a very unpractical amount of time to crack just. your. key.) And these computers are not estimated for availability for another 12 - 15 years. It would take $1 billion USD to build, and a dedicated nuclear plant to power it according to the US Government : http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/documents/pqcrypto-2016-presentation.pdf

So I'd respectfully argue with math, that I think Cryptee is safe for the average consumer to use ?Here's a fun and relevant XKCD comic about this : https://xkcd.com/538/
Shortly, and mathematically, hackers don't break encryption, they steal or guess your keys.

--- 

Regarding pricing, I'm not Google or Dropbox with millions in the pocket willing to give away storage for free, in exchange for either mining your data for advertising or selling your personal information and making money off of that instead. 

I'm funding the entire thing out of pocket at the moment, and being extra cautious with the pricing to make sure it's sustainable. And at the moment it's performing 2x better than my initial expectations. As soon as I have a better understanding of how frequently users will consume storage / need bandwidth, I will adjust these numbers, and realistically in about 6 months, it's possible to increase the storage to 50GB without changing the pricing. ?

--- 

Regarding customer experience, I agree the landing page and other aspects can be improved. In general making an educated decision about what can be improved would require collecting data about the user behavior on the site. Which is not something I'm going to do. So I'd be more than happy to hear your feedback and improve on it if you'd like to provide your thoughts regarding this. ‚úå?

I hope these make sense, 
All the best.

Hey Product Hunt,

? The story of Moniesto
Since I listened to ‚ÄúFarol da Barra‚Äù, a song from my favorite band, Novos Baianos, that talks about the Lighthouse of Praia da Barra, I promised myself that I was going to visit it in 2018.
However, I needed ? $300 to do it. So I challenged myself to ship 3 Products in 3 Months to get the money to travel to Salvador (a brazilian city) and meet the lighthouse. This is my #2 launch!

I realized that ? time is the most important thing in our lives. It has such a value for me, that my New Tab on Chrome was¬†a countdown for my death¬†(approximately, shoutouts to @connorvo).
It worked great. I understood that time was running out but I still needed to go some steps ‚ÜóÔ∏è further. Something I could use to set all the goals that were truly important for me and don‚Äôt forget about them.

Then one day I had the idea of putting my main goals on my New Tab, so I could get motivated every time I woke up and opened a new tab. This was a meaningful way to see my ? progress and the ‚è≥ countdown, so I‚Äôd never forgotten I need to fight and ? run for them.

This was the moment I decided to create Moniesto. A tool to remember and motivate people for seeking their ? goals in life.

I started using Moniesto for myself with the trip to Salvador goal and added and subtracted money each day as they were passing by. And it worked beautifully! ?

Before I reached 3 months, after my first launch (‚Äúmprove‚Äù, I made $80 with it), I also took care of a cat for a month and this gave me more $80. With this money, I finally bought the flight to Salvador. I‚Äôm paying the Airbnb in 3 monthly installments (here in Brazil we have this). At the moment, I could only pay 1 of them, so I hope I can get enough money to pay for the other ones haha. ?

So I finally reached the goal traveling to Salvador on June 15th and‚Ä¶¬†we did it! ?

Hi PH! Our team at F13 Works built ProductPro to offer a better dropshipping solution to Shopify users. We've curated products from reliable suppliers who we vet individually to guarantee the quality of our catalog. 

There are currently over 17,000 products in the app, with hundreds more added every day. Today we're on Shopify, but our goal is to launch ProductPro on all major e-commerce platforms by the end of the year. 

Let me know what you think!
@andrew_lien Great questions Andrew! Adding products is as simple as installing the app and selecting a button on the product(s) you want to add. We offer the ability to edit product title, description, and pricing before adding to your Shopify store. Our system only interacts with products from our app, so you other orders will remain unbothered.

Our top categories right now are sports & fitness, outdoors, fashion apparel, fashion jewelry, consumer electronics, and food & drink.
@huangdun That's a common misconception, but dropshipping is a legit business model. I will say that dropshipping low-quality products from overseas and marketing them falsely is the main reason dropshipping is considered a scam. However, some of the biggest retailers use this business model (Wayfair, Macy's, Target, etc.)

That's part of the reason we built ProductPro. We want to offer quality products from trusted suppliers we vet individually. There's complete transparency so you and your customers can have faith in the products you sell.
@downeastcakes Hi Nick! We have a great selection of handmade products from small businesses. One of my favorites is a scratch-off world map. We also have some collections of products featured on Shark Tank!
@huangdun I feel the main idea behind dropshipping is allowing product suppliers to access customers they previously couldn't reach. For example, if I make televisions I could sell them directly to customers myself or sell them through retailers like Best Buy. I can make money selling them directly to the consumer, but I'll never get those loyal Best Buy customers. Most manufactures aren't great at marketing, so dropshipping allows manufacturers to leverage the marketing talent and loyal customer base of retailers.

This model is being widely adopted by big retailers like Macy's Target, Wal-Mart, etc. It also allows you to extend your product aisle and offer more SKUs without investing in inventory.

For the AliExpress point, I see more retailers and customers moving away from them because of the shipping times and product quality.
@huangdun @devon_devo_frohne Well put!

My name is Alex. I'm a 17-year-old high school student in New York City, and I wanted to share something I developed to help me organize my school notes.  

NoteToScreen is an online service that lets you use your phone to scan paper documents, like handwritten notes. Once you've done that, you can access your notes from anywhere, share and comment on them with others in real time (think Google Docs), and search through what you've written. 

I'm not the first person with this idea; however, NoteToScreen is different because it's focused specifically on paper notes. Other services often try to do both typed and paper notes at once, which can lead to some weird combination between the two that I personally find confusing. Not only that, but other services often don't let you do much with your notes once you've added them in. To my knowledge, NoteToScreen is the only service with any sort of real-time collaboration for your notes!

?Story of Earsafe

As I‚Äôm keen on The Verge‚Äôs Youtube content, I‚Äôve come across a video of theirs, which was about how dangerous it is to listen to loud music for long hours through your earbuds. ?

I immediately came up with the idea after watching the video to create a menu bar application, which takes care of your ears and helps preventing hearing loss. ?

I started digging Google whether something similar exists already or not. I haven‚Äôt found any good products. I found only questions about how to limit the Mac's volume on various forums like Reddit, Quora, Apple forum. ?

So I decided to start my journey with implementing Earsafe. ?

You can find a more detailed story  on Hackernoon of why I started working on Earsafe and what I learned along the way. ?  https://hackernoon.com/i-made-my-first-5-on-the-internet-a277b421990

? Features:

Set a volume limit from a range of 10% - 80%
Toggle the volume limit
Works with Bluetooth headphones and with built-in output of your Mac
Launch at login can be turned on

I‚Äôd really love to know how can I improve Earsafe  and what you think of it ?‚úåÔ∏è";4;-3;True;True;False;community

@marcperel Hey Marc, thanks for your feedback.

- It automatically shows the top 8 apps using the more bandwidth. Would you like to display more?

- Since you see which apps consume the most network, you can close those you don‚Äôt need right now in order to get a better connection. Maybe your dropbox is actually downloading a huge file but it can wait. 

- The bandwidth consumption of a ping is marginal. We‚Äôre doing a ping every 5 sec; we‚Äôre thinking of adding a setting so you can change that interval.

@biraj Thanks for your comment! I appreciate your pov.

Your 1-4 all relate to how to it looks, but the value is that you get a dedicated service with advanced features in the backend, think of: multiple account access (ceo, hr, etc.), import and sync employees, GDPR controls, photo handling (upload, crop, filters), advanced flagging/notifications, etc..

Also I want this to evolve into much more deeper content for each employee (opt-in obviously) to increase the value of the team page.

You would get all that for the 20/month.

When I first saw IGTV I wanted to share all my previous videos there but the format was just not right for me! I didn‚Äôt like the way it cut all my videos just like Instagram Stories did in the beginning. So I quickly created this app to make it possible to share landscape videos on IGTV, I really hope you‚Äôll like it! I know this is not native content on IGTV but for people who already created a lot of content for youtube, it can be a good start to convert their previous videos in minutes.

If you have any questions, I‚Äôm here all day to answer them!

Every time I wanted to look into a new coin I saw myself looking at lots of different websites, I did not know where to look first and got lost in all of the information. That‚Äôs where Cryptobroom will help. The dashboard will show all kinds of interesting information for the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

I wanted to stay up to date with all of the altcoins. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to watch all of them. Thats why I created a way to get a notification when a coin is getting interesting. Based on all the information I gathered I was able to add a couple of filters which will point out the most interesting coins. I am aware that everybody has their own opinions on which piece of information is most important. Therefore I added settings to customize the weights in each category. This way everybody gets personalized notifications.  

Have a nice day!

@patrickjmq Currently Cryptobroom will send you buy signals based on your personal settings . If you add more value to technical analysis, you get TA signals. If you add more value to sentiment you will get sentiment signals! I hope this answers your question.

About Electroneum; At the moment only the top 100 cryptocurrencies are supported. So if Electroneum will enter the top 100 again it will be in the list! In the future I might increase the amount of coins.

Here is something I've been working on for the past few weeks. It's a simple tool for you to generate device mockup presentation for your design. You can use it to generate image for social media posts, Dribbble shots, share design with your teammates and many more! 

For now it comes with phones and browser template - more coming soon! It should be easy enough to use: 
1) Drag your design into the editor
2) Modify the canvas color, device position, size and more
3) Download as image
4) ...
5) Profit! 

Looking forward to get comments and feedbacks from all of you!

Optimizing a website or landing page can lead to a dramatic increase in the revenue it generates. I should know because I've been advising companies (like Nike and Citroen) on how to do this for many years now as a conversion optimization expert. But how do either online marketers or webshop owners know what changes to make to these pages?

Common advice would be to use one or more of the following three solutions: (1) user testing, (2) heatmaps or (3) A/B testing. Unfortunately, in practice, none of these seem feasible for the large majority of companies that want to optimize their website.

Firstly, user testing will require too much time and money (usually about $50 per tester and about 1 hour of video watching and annotations). Secondly, heatmaps (or user recordings) will only show you what people are doing on your website, not what they are thinking. Lastly, A/B testing is often the most complex, as it requires over 1000 conversions per month (orders, donations, sign-ups, etc.) for statistical purposes and a dedicated expert set up the experiments properly.

That is why we decided to create a service to help companies get insights into what people think of their website, without the need to spend lots of time/money or need high traffic numbers. That service is UserFeedback.

Today, my goal is to make you guys actually tell us your story!
No account required: just create and publish your media-rich, lucky charming story ?

TryCereals is part 1 of something I‚Äôm currently working on.
Curious? Here is the announcement ? https://bit.ly/2KEGNU8!

I would love to connect with passionate story-tellers and
feature some of what you guys make with TryCereals ?

Of course, it‚Äôs Product Hunt launch:

? Create a cereals today = get early access to CerealKit
? Subscribe to the newsletter = get a video on how to create
your own Sip newsletter app
? Feature your story here = get a fully static tappable website
based on your story, with your own domain name!

I'll be there to answer your questions, of course, but the French soccer team is playing a 4pm so expect a bit of latency from me in the afternoon ‚öΩ‚öΩ‚öΩ

@rrhoover Hey Ryan, thank you for the kind word.

First of all, I believe that whether you're selling clothes online, looking to join a company you love or launching a new product, your story is worth a thousand backs of cereal boxes. These are lucky-charming stories you can read one tap at a time. Perfect for breakfast time! 

It's cereals, but also serials: I love how habit-forming breakfast is and I've always been reading stories while eating my morning cereals. I wanted to describe both the bite-sized content (cereals ?) and the repetition (serials ?)

I've been preparing a landing page that explains it all!
@gaddafirusli really, really nice one. I've been using Shotsnapp for the launch and I'm so happy to see you here
@streamnowceo Yes it will! Plus you will gain a user space, a robust tagging system, a lot of possibilities on how to embed your cereals, templates and an API... I'll be rolling out new features in the coming weeks!
@rrhoover @jflyons I actually think you that the singular form is cereals! Kind of like a series?
@mdorsett It's not planned right now but I know it's partially possible! What's your use case?

I wanted to create a simple and easy to use tool that sends pre-built messages to target users/groups.  I have been building tools in the disaster recovery space for some time now and a lot of DR products tend to over-complicate the UX.  So while there are a handful of apps that do something similar to this functionality, I try to keep it straight-forward.

Additionally, I wanted to add this app to my suite of communication tools and the Owlorbit platform already handled Push Notifications, Sending out polls, sharing locations + creating meet-up points.. the next logical step was to create a service that handles the text messaging.

Feel free to send yourself a demo text msg (right now it's U.S. only but I'll be expanding that soon):

Harish here, one of the co-founders of Designlab. We‚Äôre an online design school that teaches UI/UX through mentor-led courses. Following up on our two other free email courses that we‚Äôve released, we‚Äôre happy to announce that today, we‚Äôre launching Figma 101! 


You all really like email courses ‚ù§Ô∏è?
Yes, yes we do. We recently surveyed our email list and found out that (free) tutorials were by far the most requested type of content. We want to make sure we give our audience what they want‚Ä¶plus Figma is a great option for our new design students since it allows them to collaborate directly with their mentors, without downloading any software. We‚Äôre also including freebies again like hotkey cheat sheets, pre-designed templates, and more! 

So why an email course again? ?
We‚Äôve found that written tutorial courses allow students more time to follow along and engage with the curriculum. We also supplement our written instructions with things like GIFs and annotated screenshots, so students always have something dynamic to help guide them through the course. 

So what‚Äôs the next email course? ?‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
We‚Äôve got a few ideas on a couple of other tools we want to teach our students, but we‚Äôre always open to suggestions! Regardless of teaching software or not, we‚Äôre definitely going to keep releasing free & highly actionable content like this to our students. 

Wait! One more thing ‚òùÔ∏è
We‚Äôre also doing a giveaway for a free Wacom Intuos Pro Tablet! For every friend who signs up for our free Figma course through your custom URL, you‚Äôll earn an extra entry into our drawing. The more people you referred, the more chances to win ?

Good question! 

Firstly, the search function is typically very weak in podcast apps. Just open any podcast app, search a person's name, and compare the search results with Listen Notes. It's like in 1997/1998: why Google needs to exist in the first place, given that many portal websites (like Excite!) provided search engine already?

Secondly, most people in the world don't know what is podcast (non-listeners), so a web-based podcast search engine is good for the podcast movement. A website is easy to be discovered & shared.

Thirdly, for people who already listen to podcasts (listeners), they typically have their favorite podcast player apps already. It's difficult to convince listeners to switch to a new app. Web is platform independent. A web-based playlist exposing RSS can work well with any podcast player app.

Lastly, I believe in unbundling podcast -- be episode-centric, instead of podcast-centric. Current podcast listening model is, you have to subscribe to the whole show, even you just want to listen to an episode. It's easy to subscribe to too many shows, leaving most episodes unplayed. It's like in the old days you had to buy an entire album even you just wanted to listen to a song. Listen Notes provides a way to search individual episodes and build playlists of individual episodes without subscribing to entire podcasts, e.g., https://www.listennotes.com/l/9848d6e17dce40278ca25a3d67288c39/wenbin-s-podcast-playlist/
@lucastoohey Hello Lucas!

Re: what others are listening to -- short answer: yes.

The community tab on podcast/episode page is a starting point, which shows who bookmarked this podcast/episode (IN LISTEN LATER): e.g., https://www.listennotes.com/c/37589a3e121e40debe4cef3d9638932a/exponent/ You can see other people's playlists there.

When more people create playlists, some interesting features can be layered on top of these playlists, e.g., recommendations, people who listen to this also listen to that, people who have similar taste as you, ... -- similar to what Spotify does with playlists.";4;-3;True;True;False;creativity

My name is Kai and i'm co-founder and Chief Strategy at Blockport, an Amsterdam based Fintech startup. 

We've just launched our Beta yesterday and we are very curious to hear what you think of our product! :)

Blockport offer a refined and extensive alternative to US largest cryptocurrency exchange: Coinbase.

What is Blockport?

Blockport is an end-to-end platform where you can buy, sell and exchange five cryptocurrencies with fiat currency.

Currently you can trade the following cryptos on our platform, directly with Euro:

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Litecoin (LTC)
- Ripple (XRP)
- Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

We aim to add USD and other global currencies within the next few months, too!

Additionally, Blockport is a 'social cryptocurrency exchange' which means that we are planning to implement 'social trading' features that enable our users to follow and copy each others portfolio and trading activities. Think of Coinbase + eToro.

In January we sold-out our Blockport token sale within 12 minutes, raising around 15mm USD worth of Ethereum. 

If you want to get involved, you can buy Blockport tokens (BPT) at KuCoin exchange.

@mickc79 do you think one longer text box with less bullet points would be more effective?
@mickc79 thanks for checking it out!
@ayush_chandra thank you! Really appreciate you checking this out and giving me feedback
@mickc79 that's super helpful to hear...that was my goal. The times where I've forced myself to simplify on paper have resulted in a short, clear verbal pitch as well. So I think it's worth the effort!!
@mickc79 probably depends who you ask, but ""why now"" is historically the biggest make/break item. but even if the time is right, if there isn't product-founder fit then it probably won't work either.
@mickc79 i will think of a way to make this part better!
@deepakkumar268 thank you. really appreciate it!
@mickc79 really sorry for the hassle. for the signup, we haven't had many issues so I'm not sure what is going on. I'll look into that now. For the one pager and screen grab would be awesome. It was pretty tight using all the input character max lengths. But might have miscalculated something.

@eboy Haha well, the more users we generate, the faster we'll be able to add more platforms!
@ipstas Hi Stan!

Our users are Ecommerce professionals - for now specifically Shopify store owners. 

What The Bazaar Network does, is it allows these store owners to receive discounts at ALL other stores within the network, as well as several other benefits exclusive only to the network.

So if you're a store owner, and I'm a store owner, you receive discounts at my store, and I receive them from yours. This allows a mutually beneficial network among the Ecommerce professionals, promoting shopping and traffic for everyone.

I hope I cleared that up for you, let me know if you have any other questions!

Cycle is a time lag accumulator - a musical system that repeats the notes you play over and over until they gradually fade into silence. It's a simple but very powerful idea, allowing you easily create fascinating and often unexpected sonic textures.

This app can be a delightful meditative experience, since the system naturally lends itself well to long and slowly evolving musical ideas.

Cycle can also be a great starting point for creating ambient music. Cycle features easy recording and exporting to both wav and midi files. Easily Airdrop or email recordings to your computer, and use them right away in your favorite DAW.

The current setup is for users to import documents (pdf/txt) from the cloud or computer and then run an analysis over them.  If a user wants to extract named entities, they can select this feature and view the results onscreen and export in csv format.  Same for dates, time, and various language features.

A user can also perform sentiment analysis & topic modeling over these documents.  This kind of workflow is geared toward data scientists, digital humanists, etc.  

I am in the process of finalizing the custom pipelines so developers or organizations can setup custom language features and expose via API or in the browser.  The use cases for these will be uploading a document and generate a timeline of events from entities. Example: Tuesday, July 3, 2018 - Jeff responded to Vlad. This timeline would be in a chronological order. 

Another use case would be selecting language features to monitor social media.  Instead of just having to choose from Sentiment Analysis, one could select stylometric features such as user mentioned our company and used this type of grammar (appositional modifier or a copula).  More so giving the user fine-grained options to select from.

I hope that helps.  I am more than happy to expand if need be.  Thanks

Hey @izaakcrook - thanks for the question!  ChatWhale allows you to automate the whole process. 

First you can add content rich welcome and greeting messages, as well as add messenger persistent menu's, to link to your most important content.  

Secondly, with the loyalty scratchcards, you can set the number of plays a user can have, the win ratio, how long till they can play again, as well as automating sending re-engagement messages to users, when they can play again!

Hope this helps, please let me know if you have any other questions.
Some great suggestions @nabeenam I love it!  I can see our dev team is going to be busy from some time to come.  

The next update we were going to add was around incentivising sharing of offers, to aid organic growth... Would you find that useful...?

Landon from Copycardinal here. Copycardinal is an on-demand, high-quality copywriting service for your online business. We will work closely with your online brand to create a compelling story, write engaging content, and build deeper relationships with your customers by building trust with words. 

I created Copycardinal because I understood how complicated it can be to write content on a weekly basis and to focus on your product development at the same time. I wanted to make this process simpler for teams that need a copy/content writer to take care of this side of the business. 

Just to list some of the types of services we provide are web content, blog posts, sales/landing pages, email marketing, product descriptions, press releases, social media posts, and business proposals. We handle a wide variety of topics in any industry and are made for startups just starting out to medium sized businesses that just need some help.

We provide all of this for a fee starting at $499 and ranging from $999 a month. Depending on the plan that you pick, you will have between 5-10 requests available for that month. We also have a one-time option to buy a single blog or proofreading strategy. Specifically for the people that want to write their own content but want to make sure it is clear of grammar, spelling, punctuation mistakes. 

If you aren't happy with the service after the first delivered request we will be more than happy to refund you 100% of the cost. No questions asked. 

I hope that cleared any questions you might have for Copycardinal. If not, I'll be on all day long to answer questions and to respond to any feedback. You can also reach out to me on Twitter at, @landon_woodrum.

Use ""PRODUCTHUNT10"" for 10 percent off on your first subscription/purchase. Thanks, everyone!
@imatincr Hello Boris! Great question. 

We start by asking you a few questions about your business/industry so that we have a better understanding of your goals and who your target audience is. We will then discuss the types of writing you would like done and how we can add value for the visitors to your website. 

Our first prioritization is that we are able to have a good fit between the copy/content we provide and the strategy that you are wanting out of our service.

I'd love for you to give us a try. If you don't like the service, we will refund you 100% of the money back. No questions asked.
@tomfrazier Thank you, Tom. I appreciate the words.

I have also noticed the lack of quality for copywriting services shared with the product hunt community. I primarily want to tackle this problem. Specifically by focusing on user feedback and providing over-the-top quality. 

Currently, we do not, but it may be an option in the future. I wanted to keep the requests lower than usual so that we can focus on the quality of the copy rather than the quantity. I would consider taking special requests to work on a deal with anyone that would expect more than 5-10 requests a month.

I appreciate your interest and comment. Thanks again!";3;-2;True;True;False;community

Hello Hunters,

This is Sai of Rey. I love design and tech. I always look to solve problems (I face) with them.

There is a major design difference with youtube for music, i.e youtube was designed for video consumption. However these days more and more people tend to use Youtube for listening to music. So the UI doesn't seem to be all intuitive for this case. I use youtube to listen to music whenever I don't find a song I like on music streaming websites and somehow I switched completely to Youtube. There must be others like me.

I got fed up one day and searched for a solution that I wanted to use but none are available to my needs and likes. So, I started developing 'Rey', basically a front-end for youtube with better UI & UX for listening to music.

Looking forward to your feedback,
Sai.";3;-2;True;True;False;creativity

- User onboarding: We‚Äôve optimized the user onboarding process to make the experience as efficient and seamless as possible.
- Mentor search tool: You‚Äôll be able to find, compare, and evaluate developers more quickly.
- Mentor application form: Applicants are able to showcase their skills and experience more accurately (with an easier process, as well!), so our team will be able to assess all mentor applications more accurately.

To celebrate the launch, we‚Äôre giving Product Hunters an exclusive $15 voucher! Which means, combined with our already existing ‚Äúfirst 15 minutes free‚Äù new user perk, you‚Äôll be able to have up to a 30 minute free mentoring session (depending on the mentor‚Äôs rate).

@fugalgolf Hi Xavier! Thanks so much for bringing that to my attention, I'll get to working on it ASAP.

At the moment there are no plans to charge for anything else but for more media storage when a team's media gets over 1.5 GB. At this point, the storage would require subscription.

Further monetization would come from inline ads in the feed, similar to Twitter. There are no ads at the moment mostly because Google's Mobile Ad SDK isn't ready, and our hosting costs aren't that much at the moment so we can focus more on the user experience first, and monetization later.

My name is roelandp, maker of the SteemWhale. I've been working as a dev for a long time and yes.... Side projects are fun! I'm excited to officially announce the sideproject I've been working on for a while now!

So when the other day my father in law asked me if I could code the natural randomness interface of a whalefountain to be deployed in the harbour of Harlingen, a city in the North of the Netherlands, I was instantly very enthusiastic!

The nice thing about this ""product"" is that it connects the digital life with the real world life. That, and then a blockchain on top! So many buzzwords. 

Also I thought it would be funny to hookup ""a Whale"" to a ""blockchain"", as many of you know a ""whale"" in cryptoterms is a bagholder / rich coin person. 

The SteemWhale runs on the Steem blockchain... This blockchain has very fast block production (3 seconds) so when you donate some crypto (preferably Steem) you will see near instant fountain spray burst! The livestream has about 20 seconds of delay though... so keep that in mind. 

The whale is planned to be at least for 10 years swimming in the harbour :) It is operational every day (unless spring / storm tide) in daytime in Central European Timezone. 

I've also included a little demonstration video! 

The website https://steemwhale.io has an FAQ on the bottom with many answers, but if you have any q's I'm here!

I'm a big fan of quotes and think that some of them can deeply inspire and motivate us especialy during hard working session ?‚Äç? 
However, searching online is time consuming and unfocus me.

So, I decided to built a free Mac OS app which permits me to receive motivation sting based on a time frequency ! On top of that I decided to add some cool features :

 -  Favorites list: like for adding a quote to your favorites list ‚ù§Ô∏è
 -  Retweet: retweet easily an awesome quote or simple copy it to clipboard
 -  Preferences: Define a frequency sting and the quote duration ‚öôÔ∏è
 -  Global shortcut: Inspire yourself from the menu bar or directly with CMD+I

Also, the app can be launched at login, support the do not disturb mode and works offline !

Please let me know your feedbacks ?

It would be better if Google Drive offered this functionality itself, but the reason why I made Filewatch is because it doesn't and I believe that it can help people to keep their files secure.

I've done as much as I can to respect the privacy and security of users when they use Filewatch. It requests the minimum possible access to your Google Drive in order to determine which files are publicly accessible and I developed it entirely as a client-side application so that no information about the files is sent to a server, it stays on your computer the entire time.

If you have any suggestions for how I can provide more reassurance to users then I'd gratefully accept them, as I can appreciate the concern.
@jeppevjensen In addition to text on the page saying 'No information about your files is stored on the server' there is also the privacy policy which goes into further detail about what data is collected.

However, If it's not clear to you then it obviously needs to be a bit more prominent, especially as it's one of the main concerns when deciding whether to use Filewatch. I'll have a think about how to improve that.

I originally launched it in 2015 ‚Äî the books now have been updated for 2018 technologies (Django 2.0 and Python 3.7) and now Hello Web App books are bundled together.

I love Python since I find it easy to read and understand as someone who has an Art degree. Django (a Python framework) makes it super easy to build web apps, with integrated admin panel (so you can update your customer's info without having to log into the database via the command line), registration and user tools, and more. I used Django to learn how to code and launch my startup in 2010 and I want to help others do the same.

I also hate most programming tutorials, and wrote these books and courses to do them better. No weird jargon or assumptions ‚Äî Hello Web App helps you create a unique idea, and walks you through building the website and setting up your HTML and CSS, adding your database, making it awesome, and launching on Heroku in just 144 pages. 

Hello Web App: Intermediate Concepts covers more advanced topics like adding Stripe integration, why and how to work with multiple models, how to add an API, and more. 

My goal was to build a full course that can help any new (or experienced) programmer launch a web app using Python and Django in a matter of days.

Happy to answer any questions anyone has! ?
@mjacksonw Aw, thank you again for sponsoring the book! The Kinsights link is still in the book, figured it was good to keep since it redirects to care.com. It was my first big sponsorship and was such a good sign for Hello Web App in my early days of publishing. Thank you thank you thank you. :D

P.S. I‚Äôll answer all comments you write below (About to go to bed as it‚Äôs 1am in L.A. right now but when I wake up I will reply SO HARD)
@peterskuta Thanks man! Appreciated!
@natalie_korotaeva Secret powerlikes groups are the most powerful. We go into in the book, but if a few groups of people with mass folllowings like your post in a short space of time, the viral spread is unreal.

@scottsilverstone You deserve a damn knighthood for this comment! Seriously though, thanks a lot!!
@greg_x_willis Hey! check again now. Full transparency: Emails can't be automated out unless the baller pays by Stripe with card. 

If someone can strongarm other payment vendors to let us do more, that would be a sick product.

Until then, we have to manually check every couple of hours and our american team was asleep (I'm here in my boxers answering this as just got up here in L.A.)

Good morning!!
@eytanbensoussan Thanks! You rock!
@junaidansari Oh man who do I have to shoot in my team?? lol. My ego hurts but my brain needs to know more. How can we improve it? :)
@andreasduess I get a bit carried away writing, I get it.

In the intro to the book I talk about ""this book isn't about helping you create a great product"" (aside from helping you get traffic to help validate the idea, etc) 

I'd rather be a little overexcited then super-pessimistic.

The growth hacks have helped just about every major startup grow massive without traditional adspend. 

Small companies can do amazing things using these hacks.

I'd rather err on the side of showing the possibility as i you're an early stage entrepreneur bad news is virtually everywhere else.

It took me from being on social welfare in the UK to having multiple six-figure businesses and moving to the United States, and has changed the lives of so many people I know, but yes, right there with you, it is a TONNE of hard work and long days, even allowing for all of the above hacks to work.

I‚Äôm excited to show you my first book , Making Sense of Auto Layout!

Ever get frustrated trying to fix red lines / missing constraint / conflicting constraint while designing layout of your iOS app? Or seeing your app works on your device but looking horrible at other device sizes?

This book is for you! 

What‚Äôs in the book?
Instead of showing you a specific complex layout to follow step by step, this book will break down and explain the fundamentals of Auto Layout and let you connect the dots before you start designing your own layout. This book will focus on doing Auto Layout using Interface Builder (Xcode GUI), but its core concept can be applied to doing it programmatically (using code) as well.

- How User Interface is being designed prior to Auto Layout and why Auto Layout is introduced
- How Auto Layout determine position and size of a UI Element by using constraints you defined
- Why missing constraints (Red lines!) appear and how to solve them
- Why conflicting constraints (Red lines, with numbers!) happen and how to solve them
- What is intrinsic content size and the importance of it
- Using Tableview for content with dynamic size
- Using Scrollview for content with dynamic size
- What is constraint priority and when to use it
- What is content hugging and compression resistance
- What is Stackview and how does it simplify constraints
Animating views with constraint

I would like to share with you our story and tell about our nearest plans. We have built Storybacker as a cozy place for YouTube and Instagram bloggers and their stories. Below you can have a look at the list of our essential features that are available in the MVP:

‚àô Explore the top social media influencers of YouTube and Instagram 
‚àô Watch hot and popular vlogs, photos and stories
‚àô Discover bloggers‚Äô live profiles (we aggregate up to 4 different channels and accounts into one Storybacker profile)
‚àô Use themes and categories to find and select the right influencers (photo bloggers and vloggers)
‚àô Select the content language of influencers‚Äô vlogs and posts (currently Storybacker supports 2 languages: English and Russian, we are expecting to add more languages shortly)
‚àô Organize and launch the proper ad campaigns to promote your product, service or startup (if needed, get the quality assistance from Storybacker team so that everything went well)

From MVP to high performance platform, we are planning to build the most engaged media network shortly. By using some of our secret sauces we expect to resolve numerous problems with boring photo & video content, spam and overloaded social media networks with fake profiles and scam. In addition, Storybacker will help with wide range of different services, from leveraging of new technologies for bloggers and followers to promotion and product placement for startups and businesses.

We appreciate any feedback from Product Hunt community and will be glad to answer any questions. Please share with us what you think about the following:

First of all thanks to @chrismessina for hunting SongBox! Amazing!

SongBox is a platform that makes demo submission easy and transparent for both the musician sending and the person receiving. 

I worked in the music industry for years as a professional musician (signed to a major label but like most, nothing major actually happened), and then from there transitioned into software development at a large music media organisation. I‚Äôve spent many years submitting demos and then I spent more years working at a place that received hundreds of demos a day. I concluded that the process is broken and unmanageable and have spent the past while building SongBox in my evening and weekend time, and now I‚Äôm running with it as a real business. 

The problem for musicians 

1) You send out many demos and usually hear nothing back.  There is a pain here as you never know if the person has listened and isn‚Äôt into it, or if they haven‚Äôt actually listened. SongBox solves that by giving immediate real time notifications to your mobile device when the recipient views your page or listens to your tracks. 

2) Songs are potentially lucrative intellectual property and if you are serious about getting your music published, and having an established artist cut your track, then you cannot put that song into the public domain, ie a social network. SongBox is about sharing privately with individuals and retaining control of who can and can‚Äôt access. 

The problem for recipients

1) this is something that shocked me when I worked on music media. The sheer number of demos received and the variety of HOW they get received makes getting through them impossible. Even people who have good intentions and WANT to discover the next great band or songwriter can‚Äôt do it. On any given day you may receive 100+ packages in the mail ranging from vinyl to cd to usb stick. That number is multiplied on email with links to bandcamp, soundcloud, files attached etc etc. SongBox provides a single platform where recipients can access songs in 2 clicks. No logins and no downloads whilst retaining privacy for the sender. 

2) People who receive demos at high volume are flooded with ‚Äúhave you listened yet?‚Äù Calls and emails and my research has made it clear that this is annoying. SongBox removes that pang as the sender will know immediately when someone has listened. 

I‚Äôll be around all day to answer questions and please not that there is a significant discount on the annual membership for Product Hunters!

Thanks so much.
@chrismessina Excellent feedback Chris, thank you!

1) Will do re the homepage. I'm working on an explainer video as we speak

2) Yes it's a way to send music privately and be alerted when someone listens. There are privacy concerns around sharing music, particularly if the end game for that song is for it to be released by you, or even more critically, someone else. SongBox provides this privacy, security and control to the musician that isn't necessary found elsewhere.

3) No the recipient does not need to be a user, this is actually one of the key factors in making this efficient. When I worked in Music media I would see so many demos get ignored because the recipient didn't have an account on the required platform OR didn't want to download MP3 files onto their machine. SongBox alleviates all of those blockers.

Each SongBox created is tagged with a unique token that is then also tied to the intended recipient in a one to one relationship (one songbox, one recipient, one token). This ensures that only the person you sent the link to can open the SongBox.

Without a link sent by the owner of the music, you can't access the page. If a link gets out into the wild (and you don't want it to) then the owner of the SongBox can kill that page dead. Rendering the link useless.
@chrismessina Also, there is an accompanying IOS app and features currently in development include:


1) Multi user SongBoxes (Invite multiple people to view the same SongBox and still get the granular reports on exactly who is listening)

2) Team accounts (let your whole band join in on the action)

3) Android app
So it's about halfway through my PH launch day and I'm really happy. SongBox has seen multiple signups from all over the world, I'm stunned. 

I've also been reaching out to some of you who didn't complete signup and I've gotten some AWESOME learnings from you all, so thanks for that. I have just deployed a new version of the site that has an extended trial period and no need for a CC upfront.

Enjoy :-)

Native iOS (and later Android) apps are in the pipeline and I would like to make these powered by local storage with the option of syncing up to the web service if the user wishes. 

One of the key drivers for hosting this as a web app in the first instance however was an interest in how large amounts of this data could be used anonymously to draw insights on what is having the biggest impact on peoples objective numerical scores and be able to share this information for the benefit of everybody.

I‚Äôve built a web tool to get the best preparation for a job interview.

The inspiration came about one year ago, while I was reading about the Bloom Taxonomy. 

I thought that with a proper and customized version of this taxonomy every Work, Study and Volunteering experience can be broken up into standard blocks.
With this model every resume can be represented as a standard matrix that I named Skill Wall. 
Thanks to this standardization, our algorithms can detect all the skills, the strong and the weak areas of a resume.

The users can upload their resume, follow the instructions to build their own Skill Wall and receive for free a proposal to improve their job interview.

I tested this model on very famous resumes:

This week, I reached a huge milestone to launch an app in the market; and while I should feel overwhelmed with joy and excitement, I spent a lot of today reflecting on how tough this 4-year journey has been. I came up with this idea in 2014. But from that time, I gave up...not once, but multiple times when I hit big roadblocks like finding developers, financing the app, and designing the app, and so many more stumps along the way. But somehow the idea of launching the app would always come back to me. 

I think one of the most powerful motivations I received from some friends was when they said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still working on that...‚Äù and somehow those words motivated me. I guess I‚Äôm a fighter. 

But after losing money with the wrong developers, having to redesign the entire app in a week (myself), and other hiccups; I pushed on. It‚Äôs been very tough juggling a full-time role and pursuing my dream in the evening, but today I just wanted to reflect and share my journey with you, because it hasn‚Äôt been all fresh roses. In fact, I think that the tough moments made me stronger and more driven to make this app for you all to enjoy. 

So while the app isn‚Äôt perfect just yet, I hope that you all see the vision and will also do what it takes to make your dreams come true. No matter how silly they may seem or how long they take to make reality, just never lose sight of your goals; because in the end, you will prevail. 

Oh, and I would love your feedback!

In this version, I added a bit of my own graphic design skills by providing a variety of editor themes with dark and light modes. Additional themes are also available through preferences.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy as much as I do and did through development.

Thanks PH for featuring my product. Really happy to see this on the homepage. 

I created this because I have been suffering from a little back pain and my doctor told me a bunch of exercises to do on different days. Since I couldn't find any one video I usually had to save different videos in my Youtube playlist. Unfortunately it is rather difficult to keep track and follow along as most videos have a lot of long intro, etc. 

So I wanted to make something in which I can put the relevant portion of the exercises with the ability to loop it and time it, so I can just follow along with the routine!

This app has been 9 months of weekends and evenings/nights in the making. I have been a part of this amazing community since the early days and always wondered when I'd be launching something of my own. I wasn't sure about doing it until an hour ago when I decided to just take the plunge and stop being nervous since I will never be absolutely happy with it :)  Shipping a project was one of my goals this year and I am super excited about accomplishing it.

I decided to build this app when I noticed that there wasn't a single app on Android that had all the features that one expects from a good image annotation tool. iOS users on the other hand had lots of good image annotation apps available. 

Here‚Äôs a highlight of some of Annotate‚Äôs features:

- Draw using multiple different shapes (circle, rectangle, rounded rectangle, arrows, etc)
- The Highlighter Tool can automatically detect text on your pictures to highlight. 
- The Text tool lets you write on images.
- Use the showcase tool to highlight important parts of your pictures
- Hide sensitive information in your images using the Blur & Pixelation tool
- Use the Magnify tool to enlarge portions of your image

I created this little tool to be used for myself, after using it for several months, thought I should share it with the world.

It also has an email verification built in to always give you working emails.

You can also verify your huge email list with this tool.

I've had this idea for a few years and kept coming back. So a week ago, while sitting in bed, I challenged myself to build a prototype in 15 minutes. It worked!

I got a very basic prototype working where people could sign up for an account (email/password) and post captions. I would manually add the photos in the database and hotlink them. No file uploads, no voting, no anti spam measures, no real design to speak of. Not even a dedicated domain name.

I shared the prototype with some friends and the WIP community. Based on the feedback and user behavior I made some refinements and added some features. First of all people kept sending me their captions in the chat as they couldn't be bothered to create an account. So I added Twitter and Facebook sign in. I also added upvotes to have non-funny and spammy captions automatically move down the list + give more of a game element to it. Initially there were both upvotes and downvotes, but people kept downvoting each other so I removed those. I also added a ""hall of fame"" leaderboard to see where you rank amongst the community. How funny actually are you?

Finally I improved the design. Added some character by adding a bunch of cat illustrations I licenses from Creative Market.

I don't have concrete future plans for it yet. We'll see if people like it. If there's enough interest I'll build out the site and eventually look into monetizing it. Here's a silly idea I had: https://caption.cat/eyeballs

Curious to hear what you think! Please give it a try.
@abadesi Haha yeah not everybody shares the same taste in humor. Plus there are a bunch of inside jokes, because many of the beta testers came from the same group chat (WIP).

My hope is that by publicly launching Caption Cat it will attract a more diverse set of users and with the voting system in place the funniest captions will automatically surface towards the top.
@graciousgarg It's pretty random right now. The original idea was to pick photos from the news, but I don't want things to get too political/divisive and I want to be careful making fun of humanitarian problems, etc.
@stefan_smiljkovic Thanks. Yeah that might be an interesting area to explore if there are enough talented users participating. Let's hope so :)
@benjamin_wheeler I don't know how old your daughter is, but viewer discretion is advised. You never know what kind of captions people will come up with.

I used Ruby on Rails, Heroku (hosting), and the Devise Ruby gem (signup/signin). I later added OmniAuth Ruby gem (sign in with Facebook/Twitter), acts_as_votable Ruby gem (voting), and switched to Hatchbox on Linode for hosting.
@rina_rasaeva The community! Once you're signed in you can upvote your favorite captions.
@fuji_syan How similar is it? My Japanese is near non-existent haha. Arigato.
@rrhoover Thanks. Didn't make it myself. Got it from an artist at Creative Market. I would credit the person here, but last time I did that I saw the same illustrations pop up everywhere the next day ?

I'm Dario, an Italian maker. I recently found out this community and it felt the right place for someone like me: I like to run ideas and turn them in useful websites.

I'm here with my first post about my project called virail: a transport metasearch (?‚úàÔ∏è?) 
I started working on it around 2013 as a side project while being employee for other companies. I saw it grow with time to the point it is now a sustainable company based in Berlin and Milano.

It has always been a hard technical challenge, dealing with so much data and make it happen in real time is way beyond any MVC project I dealt in the past. I had to find out-of-the-average solutions, the ones you cannot really find using Google or StackOverflow.

The whole world is a long winged target, but, step by step, the coverage is increasing.

I hope you like it and any criticism is welcome and appreciated!
@evivz thanks for your feedback!
1 - I'd need to know what you searched for. Coverage is not yet complete and/or 3rd party data source might be temporary down (it happens a lot unfortunately)
2 - I don't get what you mean by that you mean dates ? in this case, it might be a good idea to add an ""Optional"" to the label, thank you!
3 - Yeah, I know ads are annoying and i'm working on a way to get rid of them, but at this point they are a source of revenues that the company need";4;-3;True;True;False;community

If you'd like me to help you list a work experience for job seekers interested in working with Product Hunt, please email me at saad@truecalling.co and we'll have you quickly up and running.

True Calling is our attempt to make recruitment more human by letting job seekers book a few days of work experience at businesses that inspire them. Nobody wants to fill in long job applications, take tests, update resumes and go to interviews. And most people never hear back positively from businesses they've applied to. By leveling the playing field and giving job seekers an equal opportunity to assess employers (not just the other way around), we think people will find a world of opportunities by spending a few days at different businesses. Plus, businesses get to make some extra income -- everybody wins.

Smart, ambitious, creative people want a chance to show their best selves in a real work environment and these are the people we really aim to help. We believe the traditional approach to recruiting is not giving a chance to many of the best minds around the world, and we want to change that. The industry needs a fresh approach, and True Calling is hopefully going to be recruitment done right.

Codota and Kite have focused on syntax using proprietary sources.  So far we have focused on the first thing you do when you have a problem - You ""Google It"", we curate sources for Learning, Documentation, errors, and of course Code.  We are adding contextual source intelligence now (lets say you are a Android developer using Litho for your UI framework and you enter your query you want to see answers and results that are specific to your needs, not just a Google search for the term.)    
I know that we all need more help to write awesome code and I am very happy that there are so many smart folks working in this area - I WISH THEM ALL SUCCESS!
@bhatnagar_san You are right San, we have not updated our site for mobile at all. :(
@arminulrich We do love Vue!  and we support ALL the OSS we leverage to deliver CodePilot.ai https://codepilot.ai/about/#OSSSupport
@dsmudger Oh thats simple Dan - We NEVER share your code with any service, we do not index or transfer code to our servers.  We pass only application usage telemetry not your code.  
We try and do things as direct as possible so if you look at the app you are calling the APIs directly using your tokens, when a result set returns to the desktop app we call our services - this includes things like removing duplicate results (more than 50% of all GitHub repos are duplicates or partial duplicates), we do tag expansion for results and we rank sort results using a stateless ranker in AWS Lambda, which you can turn off too!
@w3bshark Thanks for the great question Tyler!  You are smart to ask as so many companies in this space do scan and index your code.  
We do NOT scan, index, or transmit your code to any source.  The only data we collect is your usage of features, we use this to understand how to build a better more usable app but the contents of your code, your repos, gists, etc is not send, stored, or indexed.
@joshuapinter You are right there are so many ways things are better for developers today.  My first programs were copied from a magazine, if there was a typo I would have to wait for 1-2 months for the next magazine to fix it.   One thing we have learned is you need to know the sources for your tech stack, while GitHub and Stack Overflow are generic sources often having the knowledge of a great tutorial site, sample code location, or blog makes all the difference when learning something new.  We have custom sources that are community built and targeted at specific tech stacks - so if you are a Vue.js developer using Nuxt you would have a separate set of sources and you would be able to filter results to make sure they shared the dependencies with your project.  Lots of the hard things have been done, our goal is to make it even easier to find and curate great solutions.
@afshana_diya Absolutely agree!  We have been releasing new features so fast we have not posted videos for everything yet.

First of all, thanks @duellsy for hunting Can‚Äôt Sleep! We‚Äôre really excited to be here.
At Can‚Äôt Sleep, we believe in the power of music to help anyone achieve more in life.
About 5 years ago, I discovered music psychology; the answer to why and how music changed my mood. I knew experientially that music helped me get through the day but was surprised to find scientific evidence of music helping people to focus, relax and sleep.
I started Can‚Äôt Sleep because I wanted to use this music psychology research as a tool to help people. I recognised the impact poor sleep has on society and saw an opportunity to help poor sleepers.
Can‚Äôt Sleep plays unlimited relaxing music scientifically designed to help us fall asleep faster and wake up feeling refreshed. The music is composed and played using algorithms. This makes the music unique every time, meaning it never gets boring and we don‚Äôt habituate to it. The full version lets us choose our own instruments & ambient sounds, and this personalization makes the music more enjoyable and effective. Because of the generative element of the app, in the future we can build in real-time personalization such as changing the speed of the music to match your heartbeat.
In the past few months we‚Äôve improved the sleep of Australian Paralympian Ra√Øssa Martin which reduced her migraines related to her visual impairment. See here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjcOQbg-lyw
We have a nice treat as well for the Product Hunt community: 80% off the iPhone subscription for today only. Android version is currently free.
I hope we can welcome you to Can‚Äôt Sleep, so we can help you sleep better tonight!

I do a lot of side projects in my spare time and I have developed a habit of writing about all my work on the internet. So for a long time I wanted to build a website where I could write and document all my work in a beautiful manner.

So, I started working on a theme with the sole purpose of serving individuals who want to write about their work or just want a personal blog. Whether you are a designer, a coder, an engineer, an entrepreneur, or an artist, you can use this theme to document all your life's work.

I've used Ghost as the cms platform because it's really fast and has a beautiful interface built for writing and managing posts. I've tried to keep the theme as simple and minimal as possible. These days, a lot of designers create websites that are full of animations and special effects, they look good but sometimes they are very confusing to a person approaching them for the first time. So I've designed it such that a visitor is able to grasp the structure of the website at a single look.

They are indeed using the app itself. For a lot of our influencers (and normal users), existing platforms are not providing the optimal experience for discovering interesting content and reaching a relevant audience. 

What we've done is create a more natural experience--read a story, have a thought, write it down, share it. Otherwise, it's more like: read a story, go to Twitter, copy and paste, try to remember your thought, write something down, go to Linkedin, copy and paste, and on and on. They use the app themselves because news consumption is personal and it's habitual--it's not like have a social media account which is handled by a PR person to create an online persona. 

On the community side, we are focused on curating content and commentary that is interesting for business people--be that tech, media, finance, fashion, etc. Existing platforms are so noisy, that it's extremely difficult to find relevant content and be heard, even when you have something interesting to say.

Yes, that is an interesting question. As you may read above (or about in our blog: https://avionero.com/blog/post/ten-years-of-battle-the-birth-story-of-avionero), I've been at several companies in the industry - trying to raise these limitations in how all sites are built today.

There is a combination of reasons to why other companies haven't taken up on this in a satisfying way, and one of the main one is technological limitations. The search technology behind almost all flight price comparison sites today is very simplistic and straight forward. Sure, there are modern caching techniques, etc. but the core search technology is all the same. So whenever I've been suggesting these more open and flexible - in essence more human - ways of searching, I've always been met with ""It's impossible"".

So to overcome that I sat down and draw out a whole new type of search technology, that instead makes use of modern AI and Information Retrieval theory. I then met Anton, who could turn the power of that search technology into a stunning and easy to use interface.

... and that's what became Avionero. :)

@dsmudger 1) Yeah only a few places outside the US right now but building a way for users to add local chains in the app. Coming soon! Plus, api doesn't handle major cities well yet. Working on that too. 2) Interesting point - let me think about that change. 3) same here. Will consider the swapping of the two for next update 4) I don't see this error on my build. Can you send a screenshot of this missing data? 5) So a (5) score is not bad or good. It's just neutral. Not sure the specific of the salad but does it have any positive nutrient rich attributes like fiber or protein? Those two things are equally neutral. 6) Yeah this could be a result of the api needing some tweak in cities. So working on fixes currently for cities.

I want to start with a big thank you to @grantmac_ for hunting us this morning.

 ? 

It has been a crazy and exciting time for us at VASTCLICKS so let me share a bit more about our journey and answer Grants question about our roadmap.

The whole idea started way back in the middle of last year and grew out of our own frustration running campaigns at our performance marketing agency Adidit. 

Every marketer has a number of tools and resources in their battle chest but a lot of what we were using was becoming a disjointed experience, and we still had the challenge of getting campaigns out quicker - which often came down to creating content. 

So we sketched out everything we thought we needed to relieve our headaches and focused on what we could build as an in-house tool for our own purposes.

Fast forward to the end of last year and we had a working tool with no name, however it did exactly what we needed at that point. 

Which left the question, if it worked for us why wouldn't it work for others. 

And so VASTCLICKS was born, offering everything we originally built and a lot more as a SaaS solution to everyone.

Regarding our Roadmap @grantmac_ 

We have more detailed Analytics coming in the next few days which show more than just link clicks, CTA clicks and conversion rates. 

We have the Messenger feature in the last stage of approval with Facebooks dev team, this will be the start of us introducing a full Messenger bot functionality into the platform. 

We are looking to add an RSS feature so you can pull in a blog feed and choose which articles you want to use. 

More CTA options and behaviours will be made available and browser extensions will follow, to allow users to add the article or page they are on as a VASTCLICKS link. 

We'll be here all day to answer any questions or queries you might have, so fire away!

@harish_geek   Hello - the problem slackpresence.com solves is having people look like they are online when they are not. A couple people have mentioned they are freelancers and they get more jobs if they appear online all the time - since people in their group reach out to them more. Its great for remote workers that want to appear available.
@andreasduess @ipstas  Yes I think there are a lot of remote workers using the app. a couple people tell me they make more money when appearing online all the time.  --- I think you are asking whats difference bettween free vs paid? The free version prevents your status from changing to away, but does not keep you logged in if you log out or shut down your computer. The paid version does both and allows you to create schedules. Thanks for the question!

Hey Product Hunt! 

Thanks @marcperel for the hunt! The backstory: about a year ago I went out with a big group, about 12 people, to a tapas restaurant and when the bill came we decided to split it. But there were a couple people that had a lot more than others and some that had a lot less. It took about half an hour to sort, was super painful, ruined the vibe of the evening and it still wasn‚Äôt right in the end. 

So long story short, I learned how to code and built this app to make sort those situations out. I might have called it ‚ÄúSplit the Rest‚Äù or something, because basically, instead of itemising everything like a lot of other apps do, it just let‚Äôs you set people who want to pay a specific amount and everyone else just splits the remainder. It doesn‚Äôt have to be exact, it‚Äôs just super fast and easy. So as not to ruin evenings or friendships! Hope you like it!";4;-4;True;True;False;community

My name is Eddie, and I started a photographer & model collaboration platform called Exposure.  The platform facilitates connecting the creative community together so they can create anytime and anywhere.  

I got the idea back in December when I went on a photography trip to Portland and tried using Tinder to connect with people to shoot with in the area.  I realized there was nothing better to facilitate this need, and thought that there had to be something better. Immediately when I got back from the trip, my co-founder and I started working on bringing the idea to life.

We are extremely excited to make our beta version available to photographers and models everywhere!  It‚Äôs amazing to already see creators connecting on our platform and the positive feedback that we have received from the community!  

We‚Äôd love to get feedback and answer any questions!

For starters, it was a personal challenge to build something on my own from scratch and show it to the world and that is the main core value shared by everyone on ProductHunt.? Design, backend and app all built by me, a developer. If we don‚Äôt try at least, nothing new will ever come up.? If you bothered downloading the you would have seen that if offers quite a lot for a free app and on top of that comes with some nice features at more that reasonable subscription price: real time notifications, a decent Apple Watch app and a set of watch complications that your bang average weather app doesn‚Äôt offer, let alone offer you the possibility to download it for free. On top of that I think it has a clean, refreshing design that sets it apart. In the end, the data is more or less the same for all weather apps, it‚Äôs just how you manage to display it and what do you do wit it. And I think Cloudy does a pretty good job at both. ? Sorry if I've been a little bit harsh on yourself but only by offering constructive feedback you can build a great community. ?
@cristianmoisei I think I made pretty clear what I consider to be the standout features of the app and why it's different from what it is already out there. You can say that about anything that was ever built: Facebook was ""just another social network"", Slack was ""just another chat client"" and so on. For everyone that has built a weather app the data will be more or less the same, so there's not much room for reinventing the wheel, just new ways of presenting it. That's why comments like ""It's just another weather app"" are rather shallow and don't deserver much attention. ?

Firstly - Many thanks to Hiten for hunting us! He personally introduced the team to Product Hunt and couldn't be more stoked to launch today together.

KintoHub believes microservices are the future and they can be universally compatible amongst a community of developers. We're talking about a package manager for cloud-ready features and functionality that handles the full lifecycle of code to cloud. What does this mean?

1. Developers & entrepreneurs can focus on their secret sauce. Quickly test new ideas by utilizing community made common features (authentication, email, in-app purchases, slack bots, analytics, leaderboards, exchange algorithms, image processing, etc.)

2. Save tons of $$$ by sharing the hosting costs of common features and functionality.

From idea to public launch, our story began almost a year ago from an idea that was born half a decade ago.  We couldn't be more ecstatic to share the early access tools we've built due to the mad love and hustle of friends, investors, early-access developers & the KintoTeam that got us here today <3.

We're sincerely looking forward to your thoughts & feedback as this is for all the idea makers and keyboard ninjas out there!
@cedricamaya Hey there! Thanks for the question!

That's correct, we do not have any relation to Kinto Storage.  We saw them after we came up with the name kintohub (originally we were thinking kintocloud), almost decided not to go along with it, but fell in love with it, especially since some of the team (mostly me) was addicted to Dragon Ball Super.

Fun fact - Kinto is short for Kinto'Un which is Japanese for the flying nimbus that Goku rides.  This cloud and Goku both go back deep into Chinese mythology where Wu Kong, The Monkey King, and has his magic cloud as well.
Thanks @nafetswirth! The Kinto Team had a ton of fun making it.
@bhatnagar_san Great question and example context! Quick answer, KintoHub will should you a ton of dev time and money from day 0 to IPO of your company.

To keep things simple, I'm only going to share some of Twitter's features that can be broken down into microservices: 

- Authentication/Login
- Emailing
- Profile / Account / Settings
- Notifications
- Private Messaging
- Feed/Posts ***UNIQUE***

The only microservice you would need to code is the Feed/Posts. You may agree that the rest of the services exist in 100's of thousands of apps / websites today.  The Kinto community will most definitely share different flavors of these services/features you can choose from which will be one-click deployable to the cloud of your choice. Leaving you with plenty of time to focus on your secret sauce algorithms for your new Twitter.

Each Kinto microservice (KintoBlock) is made to support an unlimited amount of apps. So if all the up-voters are using the same authentication service, it's a much more affordable solution for the community to share functionality versus paying for individual hosting.  We're also first, so these services are online only when they are needed and scale to 1000's of nodes if demand is high.

We've taken this question so seriously, that we built KintoHub itself with KintoHub! We plan to expose 100% of the tools we use to enable developers to build Twitter scale platforms.

You can read more here: https://docs.kintohub.com/docs/thinking-kinto
@hnshah thanks for the support. Being a team of developers, we're excited to share what we've built and looking forward to the developer community driving the next generation of a feature economy around microservices.
@tommytcchan Thanks for Q's Tommy! Looking forward to supporting your project on KintoHub.

0) SLA -- We're in Alpha and will have proposed SLAs once we get to Beta.  We're expecting beta in Q4 this year.  We're planning to prio multi-cloud deployment to ensure the best SLAs, especially for crypto related projects

1) Monitoring - Yes, monitoring is on the way. We paused this feature because there are too many ways to do this.  We're having an open Q&A / AMA later this month to open up the question to the community. Would love for you to participate - if you signed up, you'll receive an email next week about it.

2) Pricing - We're free today and will always have a free tier.  We are planning to have a mix of a tier based system starting at ~10 USD up to a ""pay as you go"" model.  The pay as you go will be a pay-per-second model thanks to serverless. To increase resources/instance size, we look at these as ""Addons"" which would be a monthly fee. You can also add-on databases or analytics in the near future as well.  We'll be sharing more August 2018 and hope to have an open discussion with the community about this.

3) Yes - Contact us via slack or email and we can discuss this.  We're tested on AWS/Google/Azure so far and can do private managed or unmanaged solutions.  Today, all services you create on KintoHub are private to the members of a workspace by default if you want to start now on https://www.kintohub.com
@peter_theill please try again and this should work.
@kj_singh1 Agreed! With community powered universally compatible KintoBlocks- the microservice movement is real.
@olga_ruban Thanks for the question!

Yes, our pods scale based on load. Currently the scaling system is limited to CPU/Memory, but we preemptively spawn services so that when a service is in need, it takes a second to load versus waiting a minutes like on traditional auto scale systems.  The next step will be to do it based on incoming load, such RPS/QPS algorithms describe (which I'm guessing you're talking about). Great read here which may tickle your interest.

https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scryer-netflixs-predictive-auto-scaling-engine-a3f8fc922270

In the future, we will have features to fine-tune your scaling. Some use cases is that during high traffic periods, people like to keep reserve resources (let's say 20 CPUs) ready during 7-9PM.  Otherwise, we can solve this with machine learning as well!

We're investigating the best tools to provide you all as we discuss them in the Kinto community.

When I started exploring microservices a few years ago, I had to learn kubernetes, advance my knowledge on docker, grow a tuft of grey hair after using Consul/LinkerD/Zookeeper for service discovery... the list goes on for what it takes to just start building microservices.

More than ecstatic to push the KintoHub platform to help aid developers who just want to get [insert four letter word for poop emoji here] done and start building + sharing microservice features/functionality.
@liv3dr3amlov3 Hello Fellow Microservice Advocate!

Couldn't agree more - thank you for your kind words!  Managed database options are being worked on as I type this message. Expect them to be available soon!
@mathilde_mham Thanks for the question.

Answer is, YES! We do have a lot of plans with GraphQL.  I wish I could share more, but unfortunately its still early days.

We're currently in Alpha with gRPC (documentation to be launched soon) and HTTP is fully supported.  We'll ensure all protocols are cross compatible with each other (you can speak to graph QL in grpc, and vice versa).";4;-2;True;True;False;community

Good question, I was thinking of it as well. I don't think there is a way to guarantee that 100% for the simple reason that if anyone wants to share a password they can simply copy & paste anywhere. For Wirepool I'm working on a report/rating system I will add which could help, but I'm always open for help and suggestions :)
@metaminds your points are totally valid.
Regarding the Data VS Users paradox, I was just discussing this with a friend and I'm trying to collect other sources to seed the app with an not rely solely on users. If you have any plz lmk :) 
Regarding ""why app first"" and you may or may not agree with me. I think the app is just a good infrastructure to start with. With web, users will mostly forget or won't share any WiFi they connect to. But with the app sending notifications asking the user to share the WiFi the DB will grow faster and more . So Web app is my next step with all the data I'm trying to collect. :D

What do you think?
@amnashamimnyc <3
@whiletrueeat Thanks .. waiting for your feedback :)
@naping Thanks, hope you like using it. Let me know if you have any feedback!
@adithep_narula agree with you. Hackers could use it for MITM, on the other hand it's the same risk of connecting to any public wifi. I added some waring messages to the app not to share private networks. Probably should add another warning when user try to connect to a wifi and maybe advice to use a VPN. What do you think?
@footer I think FB ""find wifi"" is shops promoting feature. it doesn't share the wifi and not the speed of the network which I do both with Wirepool. Do you think it has an advantage over Wirepool? plz lmk
@guillaumebardet That would be great!

? Problem: I created Handlescout after personal frustrations with unavailable Twitter usernames.

? Solution: Handlescout automates the process of checking Twitter username availability and notifies you by email when the availability status changes.

? Price: FREE!

From idea to launch, the project took about 10 days to complete (after work hours).

Hello @amrith, I know the pain, been there ? You correctly identified the *current* scope of the project, which to me seemed like an obvious starting point, but I'm very much open to extending the product to further increase it's success rate.
@isiahhill The automated checks at at their current frequency (1 per hour) will always be free ?
@moeamaya Thank you for your question ? Couple of ideas I considered: convincing account owners to give up their name, assist username claims via trademark laws,  retrieval of usernames attached to expired domains, auto-claim the account and squat it on behalf of the user, auto suggest additional usernames based on the submitted one, etc...
@guillaumebardet Thank you ? I did, and it's not out of the question, but I had some doubts because A) sending PMs on Twitter programmatically doesn't work when people turn them off and B)  publicly broadcasting updates might not be suitable for those who want to keep their desired names as secret as possible. I am however considering creating a Twitter account where I'd broadcast all status updates for 3-letter accounts that are not yet registered by users ?. Cheers!
@chuckreynolds Thank you! But if/when they do, you'll have an advantage ? Also, don't rule out the possibility that the current owner forfaits it!
@chuckreynolds I know the feeling ? We are exploring other solutions to this problem!
@airjoshb I'm extremely pleased to hear that since it's probably going to be my next product ?

@kullyjethwa Wow, thank you Kully that means the world. Super excited to see how the product fits into the day to day marketing for brands - I believe content is more powerful now than ever and creativity/speed needs to match the demand.
@rrhoover Ryan, your comment brought a HUGE smile to my day! Thanks so much for taking a look at what we've made and I really hope we can play a part in making the lives easier for many budding entrepreneurs! If you have any feedback or improvements/suggestions, I welcome them with open arms ?
@kullyjethwa Boom! Might have to 'borrow' that tag-line :D
@joelrunyon Hey Joel! Great Question ?We work with third-party couriers to have products collected from customers the next working day (If ordered before 1pm, UK) - The products then come to our studio and our queued in our Production Cycle.

The customer receives e-mail notifications at each stage so they know where their products are and at what stage of the production cycle their order is at.

Images are then created within 7 working days based on the customer's order preferences and made available to download in their Dashboard.

-

I hope that helps give some insight into how the process works in general. Perhaps Our Studio page would also be helpful: https://feedsauce.com/studio/ 

What are your thoughts on first look anyway? Is this something you could see yourself potentially using or recommending?
@thepatwalls Thanks a lot Pat, great to know you like the idea. Would love to find out more about how I can help your folks at Starter Story!
@hanna_zenkova ?We're suckers for a nice pic too Hannah! Thanks for your support and vote of confidence - super excited to build out the future of Feedsauce. If you have any suggestions to help us improve in any way, I'm all ears :)
@joshuapinter ?Joshua you're a star, just fixed the typo on the Pricing page. 

Yes, we're already accepting international orders, however we request the customer to send their product to us as we haven't quite cracked the International collection logistics. Our plan is to introduce free collection and returns worldwide, I think it will be an awesome experience for brands and hopefully generate recurring business from those brands.

If you have any thoughts/suggestions feel free to chime in!
@rabbia_hena You guys have been an integral part of our launch and really helped us learn the ropes in terms of delivering an efficient and high quality service to brands.

Gradient Backgrounds is a curated collection of the ultimate list of the best gradient sites (many pulled from Product Hunt!). With 1000+ gradients to choose from it's easy to find the ?color!

? The ""Background""
Apparently I'm pretty into gradients and backgrounds because my last two launched sites, cssgradient.io + coolbackgrounds.io, directly lead to the creation of this new site‚ÄîGradient Backgrounds! When I shipped CSS Gradient  everyone asked me to create more pre-made gradients, but there were already 1000s of super nice gradients across the web. So instead I curated the existing sites in one place to make it easy to browse everything at once.

Are you satisfied with the features Apple Dock provides?

I'm not....

I created ActiveDock because the Mac Dock does not have the ability to switch between windows, change the appearance, and conveniently group elements, and does not allow you to hide unused items.


Main Features
¬† - Window Previews Panel - allows you to view and switch between windows, as well as resize and move your windows
- Themes
- Groups and Folder Views - for convenient grouping of items
- Start button to quickly launch applications and open folders
- and much more

I want to simplify the application and plan to rewrite 70-80% of the code in order to simplify the application and make it more intuitive

I will be grateful for your feedback and advice.

Recently I redesigned my lifestyle and in the process built HabitBoard to help anyone do the same.

? My Story
At one point in my life I was stuck in a rut. I was overweight, bored with my work and mildly depressed. Wisdom of the Internet suggested that you can overhaul your life if you become aware of your habits and start managing them. This is exactly what I did and in the process I returned to my regular weight (-20kg / -44lbs), learnt to code, switched careers to tech and now make my own apps.

? Another Habit Tracking App?  
Although you can perfectly track your habits on paper or in a spreadsheet, recurring and long-term nature of habit tracking screams for a software solution. No surprise there are so many habit tracking apps already on the market. Still none of them felt just right for me, so I created my own with a new spin on design, simplicity and organisation.

? Introducing HabitBoard - Focused Habit Tracking for Minimalists
Here are the key features:
* Clean minimalist design focused on essentials
* Dashboard / card style UI fitting ~12 habit cards to track today‚Äôs & this week‚Äôs progress
* Areas to group your habits any way you want e.g. around time‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämorning routine, evening, topics‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääe.g. health, education, etc.
* Progress calendar to see and track full history of your habits at any point in time
* Visual streaks: if you reach a habit‚Äôs weekly target, it will visually stand out in light green color
* Dark mode (coming soon)

? Affordable Pricing
* HabitBoard is free to use for up to 5 habits and 1 area
* One-time pro upgrade for unlimited habits and areas at $0.99 / ‚Ç¨1.09

CEO of Bart Solutions here, we previously built the popular extension of 'Simple Gmail Notes' ?

Today we are excited to announce Simple Mobile CRM! 

It's a super simple CRM that targets on small teams, here are some core functionalities:

1. Notes marked on gmail (vis Simple Gmail Notes) could be synced to mobile devices (iPhone / iPad / Android)

2. We provide Smart Calls, which automates call recording, transcription and segmentation.

3. We logged down all action history, which could be searched later

4. Todo, email, contact management, etc...


'Simplicity' is the only thing that matters here, and we try to keep CRM users sane!

We provide free member signups without time limit, come and have a try :)
@farman28745228 we spent a lot of time working with CRM systems and found that the majority of use was really just trying to keep communication events organized.  90% of the other features just don't get used by small businesses because you don't have a big team to collaborate with.  

Most people we talked to were managing their opportunities in their email and cell phones.  So they are communicating with contacts via text, calls and email and it gets to be a mess especially if you are talking to vendors about different opportunities.  

So we just focused on a way to bucket communications by opportunity with just a few clicks and left the complexity behind.  You just create an opportunity, then add contacts you want to track the conversation with about that topic.  If I'm having a conversation with vendor about project A and then another about project B, I can link and sort all the communication history with that contact to an opportunity.  

For email, we focused the initial launch on gmail, so we sync with simple gmail notes. You add a note, hit sync and it will pull the emails into your conversation log for that contact automatically.  You can sync notes back from the app as well.  We'll add more platforms as we grow.  

For calling, the user can just make a regular call and the system will mark the call time or you can utilize Smart Calling (*only available in certain countries) which records and transcribes the conversation in the history.  Its pretty slick.  

Text is marked by timestamp so you know when you sent the contact a text and can look up in the phone history.

It's truly something special.

Right now, in a hundred different tech offices across the globe there are a hundred different teams all building a billing system for their product/software by spinning up a server and database and writing a bunch of code to integrate with Stripe's API or PayPal's or Recurly's, etc. Everyone is writing the same code... over and over.
That all ends now ?
Flexkit is an easy to use HTML API that makes it incredibly easy to build a full-fledged billing/membership system using the Plasso platform. You can turn any UI you've built into a fully working product JUST using HTML. No need to write any API code or javascript code to handle errors, UI, validation, etc. Flexkit does it all for you ?

In Lay Terms
You can turn any of those fancy checkout mockups you see on Dribbble into actual working/production checkout experiences in a few minutes. ?

How It Works
Flexkit works completely stand-alone. No frameworks or plugins required. It uses tried and true HTML forms as its backing technology. That's right, no need to learn a new framework or ""templating language"" ? It works everywhere!

How To Use It
Just add a few Flexkit specific HTML attributes to your forms and include the javascript snippet on your website and you're done! ?

What To Do Next
Watch the video above and go build your next project with Flexkit!
@zoltanhosszu ? Thanks :)
@joshpuckett Howdy Josh! Great question. Flexkit puts a hidden iFrame on your page. It then hijacks your forms and instead of submitting the form data server-side or over ajax it makes use of a cool browser tech called PostMessage. That means in stead of sending data over the wire, it simply passes the data down to the iFrame in the DOM. The iFrame is a fully secured Plasso page that processes the data. So its all HTTPS and 256bit secured. That means it works the exact same as if you were to secure your own HTTPS page and send your own data to Stripe or PayPal ?
@phippuuuu Hey Philipp! You can build your own membership system with this, but right now you can't build your own market place. Right now each of your merchants would need their own Plasso account. HOWEVER, a market places system is 100% already on the list to build here at Plasso ?
@awt Because it's hard to do!! ? Thank you!
@mylesgolden1 You can use Plasso with your Stripe OR PayPal account ?
@itsthisjustin no code is just the right amount of code ?

The core Appbot product was built for mobile app developers, allowing them to monitor, analyze and action their app reviews quickly and easily. 

Since we started Appbot we‚Äôve received a lot of requests from users wanting to analyze all of their customer feedback, using the same toolset they use for app reviews. 

Custom Data Sources allows any organization to quickly and easily analyze a large body of text feedback from any source, like support tickets, social media or survey responses. We automatically analyze the feedback to show trends in sentiment and content. This makes it much easier for organizations to action the complaints and requests of users at scale, and saves hundreds of hours per month that would be spent categorizing the feedback manually. 

We offer a full featured free trial - head over to appbot.co to check it out!

We are definitely still working on optimizing the price point. There are a bunch of great features in the pipeline that will justify the cost but I want to make sure we have a fair price for where the product is at now. Would you prefer a transaction percentage rather than monthly?

There are two ways of collecting updates: 1.) A maker submits it through the website 2.) I get in touch with makers and publish updates
Either ways, only those updates are published that a founder wants people to know about. Early-stage News doesn't publish scoops or stories; these are just updates that makers can tell the world about and celebrate. It is a dedicated platform for entrepreneurs to celebrate the little victories (because only millions/billions of $$$ in funding, acquisitions or attaining unicorn status doesn't equate to a successful startup. There are others milestones that have no platforms for makers to publish to)

Think of it as TechCrunch but for all kinds of milestones ‚úå

@pdziedzicz Hi Peter, yes, we are working some specific use cases, at the moment we have a food delivery service showing more ands and push notifications on rainy days, and a stock market company showing different ads depending on the stock price. We are also working with a Real Estate company.
Regarding optimization, that works only when the ads are running, so if you set your ads to run only on rainy days, Adwords and Facebook will run their optimization without any issue, and actually without knowing, they would optimize for people willing to buy on a rainy day, making Metri even more efficient.

@talantorriero I appreciate your question -- based on your question we just created a guide that walks through the methodology and approach we take when we assist you with SSL Installation.  It's behind an e-mail capture, so I will shoot you a private message with the link!
@ikayhargley Your question is awesome and got us thinking about how we can offer that solution.  I think that's a big opportunity and a service that agencies might like to outsource to a partner. Let's do this!  I will shoot you a PM and keep you posted on our plans.  Thanks again for taking time to review and share your ideas.
@jon_tavarez Thanks for your question!  Sometimes a website does have SSL installed though the website's settings have not been configured all the way to automatically redirect someone from HTTP to the HTTPS URL that loads with the SSL cert.  Would you mind shooting me your domain in a PM and I'll take a closer look in case there is an issue?  I appreciate your time to provide us feedback!
@blossomshirts I like to hear that about no fees!  That usually means you are on a website hosting provider that makes SSL easy and free like it should be.  What we've learned over the past several months is that there are many website hosting companies that aren't doing a great job with it unfortunately and still choose to charge customers.  

We use Let's Encrypt Free SSL certificates and our service is to provide the white-glove care targeted towards non-technical webmasters such as small business owners.

For our fee, we spend the time needed to get these non-technical folks set up correctly with SSL.  After the installation, we take additional steps to ensure redirects are implemented correctly to pass SEO value, and we update any hardcoded URLs in code or pages to avoid insecure domain warnings.

May I ask who you host with?  Kudos to them!
@lianne_carla_savage How cool!  I'm a big fan that you're starting her out early with good habits for security and data privacy matters. Please pass on my high-five to your kiddo for her entrepreneurial spirit ? -- amazing!
@joergst I love this feedback and appreciate that you took time to detail a few ideas of what you would want in an FAQ page!  I couldn't agree more -- we'll get that FAQs set up asap to help customers understand the process.  I'll send you a PM with our DIY guide notes that outline some of these points in the meantime.   

As I'm catching up today, I'm stoked about this reoccurring idea in the comments of agency discount or volume discount.  That would presumably allow anyone who works with clients, to outsource this need to us.

Is that the kind of reason you were thinking about volume discount or is it for multiple sites you operate?
@marz I salute you for pointing out something that should be approached with some skepticism.  You are absolutely right that you should not be sending your certificate out to someone you just met online!  

We utilize Let's Encrypt and depending on the web hosting provider, the process for installing the Free Let's Encrypt may be a click of the button or possibly require accessing your hosting via SSH.  

The way we handle security is either 

1) connect with our customer on a web meeting and simply have them share their screen while we guide them through everything, or ...
2) if our customer is someone who trusts us from working together before, they transmit their credentials to us via LastPass.

Let me know if you have any suggestions on how we might improve that sort of awkward first conversation about security between strangers.
@kmnei Hey Karim, thank you so much for taking time to review our product and provide this welcomed feedback!  

FYI, one of the pricier, yet solid WordPress hosting companies I really like is WP Engine.  They offer a Free SSL cert via Let's Encrypt and it's a click of a button to install.  If you haven't heard about Let's Encrypt, it's worth a look at who backs them and their vision to make secure sites ubiquitous: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt

The coolest part about Let's Encrypt (besides being free) is that the certificates are 3-month long durations that auto renew.  So if you follow the methodology and install Let's Encrypt correctly with a cron job or scheduled task on your hosting, the certificate will auto renew into perpetuity.  Meaning, once you have it set up correctly, you're good to go forever, SWEET!

So to answer your question about why the SSL is free from is, you probably guessed it:  we're utilizing Let's Encrypt ?

Hosting providers can make SSL installation tricky if they aren't already on board with this idea of Free SSL from Let's Encrypt.  We've found over the past several months that non-technical customers such as small business owners really just want someone who is friendly, knowledgeable, and cares about their business to 'hold their hand' through the process so they don't make any costly mistakes with broken pages / assets that might hurt their SEO rankings.  

In essence, that's what we're charging for -- the time on a phone call or web meeting to work with a person who has your best interest in mind.
@joergst Music to my ears!  I'm running on adrenaline from a great Hunt today and will be tackling the volume concept soon.  Let's stay in touch!
@mesimoniv Mark, I got a good chuckle from that ? .  I'm glad to hear you think it's a good value!  I assume that means you have spent some time with an SSL installation before? Hopefully, it was not a situation where you ended up ""banging your head on the desk"".  SSL can definitely be frustrating and I hope we're alleviating that pain with Secure My Website!";4;-5;True;True;False;community

But then @andreyazimov suggested the idea of ""baked"" pages that can be used for Twitter Card Validator or shared with your team members and I was like ""holy shit, this is awesome!""
So we did it ?

Realtime editor will guide you through each field and help prepare the right launch materials which you can then package, download and be ready to go once the timer hits midnight PST (which we also show you ?)

Be sure to <a href=""https://previewhunt.com/"">give it a shot</a> and check examples like <a href=""https://previewhunt.com/posts/nomad-list-3-0"">this Nomad List</a> page I shamelessly copied from @levelsio's launch.

Hope you find this tool as useful as we do and you can nail that next launch ?

I think Flux adjusts the colors of what you see by fiddling with the GPU configuration. It also has a brightness setting that has nothing to do with the native brightness setting of the monitor's (the one you see in the OSD menu when you press the monitor's physical buttons). I'm not sure how it does it, but I think it just makes the pixels dimmer/darker.

Lunar on the other side adjusts the native brightness and contrast settings of the monitor using the DDC protocol. You can see that changing the brightness with Lunar will also be reflected in the monitor's OSD menu. This should give a more natural dimming.

So I guess you could use both f.lux and Lunar, as they do different things. F.lux can adjust the display color temperature, and Lunar can adapt your brightness and contrast based on the ambient light in your room.

That's how I'm using it right now, just that I'm using the native macOS Night Shift instead of f.lux.
@justcharlie @derk_jan_karrenbeld Nice find!

Indeed, f.lux and native macOS adaptive brightness work very well together! ‚òÄÔ∏è

But for external monitors, if you have the brightness set to 90 for example, no matter how dark or warm you set the pixels, you're still getting pretty much the same amount of light in your eyes if the monitor brightness doesn't change. It also uses more electric energy. ?

With Lunar, your external monitors can save some energy and lower the strain on your eyes when the environment gets darker. 

I have a pretty messy schedule, I work in the morning, noon and late at night with pauses in between. So I pretty much depend on the natural light and I would have to always adjust my monitors' brightness and contrast to be in sync with my Macbook built-in display. That's why I made Lunar, to let it do this for me ?
@vladkorobov Yes, that's exactly what it does ?
@ayush_chandra Thank you!

I wish it would be that easy to port it, but I would need to completely rewrite it for Windows because Lunar is written in Swift and uses low-level macOS APIs.

There are a few Windows projects that allow you to control external monitors, but they're not so automated:

3. screensaver mode to display collected icons.

Thank you.

Hi,

It is a beta test, thereby features and inner implementation may be changed.

Welcome to the 2,497th habit-tracking tool launch you‚Äôll see on PH this year! I feel so unique, a true innovator ?

Second app I launch on PH since I left my iOS dev job. I have this crazy idea of trying to join the club of digital nomads living from their products. Currently at $150 a month, it looks like I should get there within the next 7 decades, which is pretty exciting ?. I‚Äôve had to start freelancing to pay the bills, but I still try to find time to build my own apps.


? <b>Idea</b> 
A year ago, I decided that if I wanted to be able to play the piano ? by the time I‚Äôm 80, I‚Äôd better get started. We tend to burn out if we do too much at once ? and give up if we focus too much on results ?, so I simply committed myself to play 15 minutes a day, every single day where I had a piano at hand.
So you know how it goes: obvsioulsy, I wanted stats. So I printed a paper calendar ? that I stuck to my wall, ‚úò crossed off each day during months, wondered if an app could replace it ?, and -believe it or not- was not able to find an app that showed me an entire year of habit on a calendar that would fit entirely on my ? iPhone screen! 


? <b>Building</b> 
So of course, I built one! Manipulating dates is a dangerous task and I spent 100+ hours ? making sure this worked perfectly regardless of your time zone. So I‚Äôll need quite a lot of sales before this makes any financial sense. But hey, makers gonna make! ?
The app lets you track daily habits and creates yearly calendars. It calculates your current and best streaks, and your completion rate per year. There are no weekly habits for now but I want to add them later on: I‚Äôd love to hear any idea on how this could look on the calendar and how you'd like completion to be calculated.


? <b>What do I get for free?</b>
The app is free and everyone can track two habits for life. A 5$ one-time fee unlocks unlimited habits, dark mode, and supports my indie dev challenge?.


? <b>One more thing</b>
The first app I launched got almost 200 upvotes here, got me a few hundreds downloads, ended up top 10 of the day and gave me a HUGE motivation boost. So I‚Äôll make use of this opportunity to THANK YOU ALL for your support last time! ??

Thank you PH,
Kevin

PS: Fellow hunters on Android, to anticipate the dreaded question, the app is unfortunately not available on Android. As a solo developer with limited time, I have to focus on one platform at the moment.
@akdm_ Wow, glad to hear that, thanks Anthony!! If you have a minute, a rating on the App Store helps a LOT climbing the rankings ?You can do that easily via the Settings tab. Thank you!!
@3raxton Thank you so much Braxton!

Fun fact: during the development phase, I actually implemented subscriptions into the app (in part to try @jeiting 's great RevenueCat product), and ended up changing my mind right before launching and switching to a one-time IAP. That might have been a good decision, given your comment. But I should A/B test.

And the piano journey has been absolutely amazing and rewarding so far. I found a fantastic teacher that is able to explain me the neuroscience explaining ""why"" we need to focus on certain types of exercices or techniques. I am slowly starting to play pieces that start to sound ""good"" while being simple, so I suspect that within 2 years, I'll start playing some great pieces. It's very rewarding, and requires going through the first 6-10 months of exercices that are not very impressive nor beautiful to the ears. Do you play yourself?

Thank you again!
@sam_robbins Thank you Sam! I gave a small explanation at the end of my first comment but basically, I unfortunately have to focus on one platform... I work on this after my freelancing hours, and am not familiar with Android (yet?), so I'll first see if this works on iOS. Really hope you'll find an Android alternative that'll suit you though!
@myle_goel Thank you so much MyLe. I'm based in Barcelona and I am taking on short to mid-term remote freelance projects, so if that could fit your needs, would be happy to chat!
@3raxton Nice catch, thank you! I am not a native speaker, so this is really useful feedback to me ? Will change this in the next update!

We launched the Master of Letters podcast to help surface ideas, tactics and lessons around what people are doing to drive traffic to their sites.

Each episode sees us interview a CEO, marketer or consultant where we ask them two key questions:

1) What are you doing today to drive traffic to your site(s) and
2) What do you do with your visitors once they land on your site to engage or convert them?

These questions are designed to provide actionable, real-life examples for our listeners whilst also being broad enough so that you can answer the question in your own way, based on your experience and where you are as a business.

We pre-recorded 8 episodes before we published the first one. By that time though, we realised that we needed the episodes to be tighter and more to the point (AKA those two questions above). Up until episode 8, the interviews are a little broader. Still really interesting, but less direct. If you subscribe I'd love to know what you guys think after episode 8 has aired.

We hope you like what we've put together here. I'm happy to answer any questions.

Finally, if you'd like to be interviewed on the podcast, please head to https://missinglettr.com/podcast/master-of-letters/ and follow the link.

I'm Clement, the developer of WebRadio.io. To give you a little background on myself, I'm a maker who loves building businesses, websites, and sharing / discover music. I've been working as a webdeveloper since 2011.

Deep down, I've always been a bit of a ""tool maker"" and wanted to build a site where webradio owners could benefit from truly beautiful audio players for the web. Webradios are an amazing way to discover new music and listen to podcasts.

I've worked a lot in the past year on improving my audio analyser library, that is used now to generate radio visualizers. Each template was carefully designed to allow branding customisation, and each one includes lots of colour and brand logo support to get you started finding the right 'look' for your webradio page.

As any webradio owner knows, the tricky part of a webradio page is to display the title of current song being played on the page. I've develop a bunch of different methods to do so, and they all take maximum 3 minutes to setup!

Anyway, it feels great to finally have something up on the site! We hope you like the webradio.io site (and product) and please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!";4;-2;True;True;False;community

Hi Michael,
Since the beginning I've always had a vision of bringing this to both platforms + with an accessible web component (a great use-case for which would be coaches having access to their client data). However, up until now I have been spending all of my time after my regular work hours and on weekends to bring the iOS app to life. It can be tough solely designing and developing for multiple platforms on my own in a part-time capacity, but in the future I hope I'm able to get more resources to join me in bringing Liftr to a wider stage.

In the meantime though, I will 100% be continuing to support and work on (hopefully awesome) updates to the iOS app for the foreseeable future. And I am also exploring the feasibility of a MVP web dashboard piece that I could hopefully add by the end of this year. I will keep you updated when any new developments occur :)

Please Watch our product demo video TO GET A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF A WORKING BETA. OR DOWNLOAD TO EXPLORE MORE

Social Media Card (SMC) is a tool for simplifying the complex world of Social Media. It‚Äôs a new way to smartly organize and manage multiple platforms in a clean user-interface.

SMC is great at doing two things better than anybody else

1.    It helps you promote and highlight your complete online presence with a unique ‚ÄúMaster Social Handle‚Äù.

2.    It makes it super easy to create, schedule and post content on multiple platforms. SMC comes with Anna, your virtual social assistant, who will be assisting you to take your social media game to next level.

The best part, this app is free, in fact it is better than free, because this app will give you back time; instead of figuring out how to coordinate your social media across all of the different platforms, this app will do it for you. That means more time to create better content, to grow your business/presence, and to enjoy your life, while saving you 100‚Äôs of dollars every month.

Save time and manage all your social media in one place. SMC‚Äôs ,Anna is a simpler way to schedule posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Google+.

No more wasting time, no more logging into multiple social accounts. Any link, text, picture or video - just tell Anna and you can quickly choose when and where it‚Äôll be posted.

Why you'll love SMC with Anna...
‚Ä¢ Share to multiple Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Google+ accounts from one place.
‚Ä¢ Maintain a consistent presence on social media, so you can build your following and influence.
‚Ä¢ Schedule your posts automatically so you never have to worry about setting a time and date, or customize the timing of individual posts. Scheduling has never been easier or more flexible.
. Never run out of amazing content with Anna content suggestions.

We are opening Social Media Card ( Smc) for Public beta with some features still under construction.

We would like to invite the Product Hunt community to download SMC and give us Some valuable feedback , so we can improve our offerings.

We would love to answer any questions right here on PRODUCT HUNT . PLEASE STATE YOUR QUESTIONS IN YOUR COMMENTS AND WE WILL REPLY PROMPTLY!

Hi Everyone,

My name is Rachel Kaplan and I‚Äôm the Co-Founder of H-PROOF. I graduated from Columbia Law School and then dove into startups, first helping to grow Tough Mudder (as employee #20) and then moving to VC-backed Chloe + Isabel. I teamed up with my mom, board-certified surgeon Dr. Linda J. Kaplan, MD, to develop the first chewable tablet that helps prevent your hangover symptoms.

Hangovers are awful, and we think you deserve to have fun tonight, and have a great tomorrow, too. That‚Äôs why we created H-PROOF. It‚Äôs a black cherry-flavored chewable tablet that contains 15 B Vitamins, Antioxidants, Liver Detoxifiers, and Electrolytes. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit in your pocket, and we have a patent pending re: our delivery and absorption technology. 

Over the past year, we‚Äôve been beta testing H-PROOF with family, friends, and friends of friends, and we would love to get feedback from the PH community. We‚Äôve started the manufacturing process, and if you sign up now, as a thank you, you‚Äôll get 20% off when we launch!

The idea came from friends and clients constantly running ideas past me to get my opinion. It's hard to tell if an idea has potential without putting out there (even in a small way), and it's even harder to muster the resources to make it into a real product. Harry and I thought we'd open up this process to let the community decide and see where it goes from there.

By way of background ‚Äì I run a product agency called Crowdform (https://www.crowdform.co.uk/) and a venture builder called Ourselves ‚Äì so identifying good ideas is a core part of what we do. Read more here - https://www.crowdform.co.uk/blog/building-venture-studio/ But the most important step is actually building them, and doing so better and faster than the competition. Part of the purpose of Ideas Are Worthless is to reach out to founders who might want to work with us, and can demonstrate to us, investors and customers that their ideas aren't...worthless.

So happy to finally be on Product Hunt! It's been 4 years since we started rewriting CKEditor from scratch. You may know the previous versions of the product ‚Äì first FCKeditor, then CKEditor 3-4. They‚Äôve been on the market for more than a decade and while CKEditor 4 is still a robust solution, we realised that we cannot develop it iteratively forever. We needed a clean slate, so CKEditor 5 was born.

You may wonder how did we manage to spend 4 years on building a rich-text editor (if you know contentEditable you know that you can create a simple rich-text editor in a matter of minutes). It turns out that the whole complexity lays in this single goal:

> Create a flexible and extensible framework for implementing rich-text editing solutions with support for real-time collaboration and complex model structures.

As short as it sounds, it made us implement a custom data model designed to work with Operational Transformation. It's tree-structured so we support complex features such as tables. Furthermore, we wanted developers to stop thinking about the nightmares of dealing with contentEditable, so we implemented a virtual DOM which hides contentEditable's quirks from your sight. To make the platform really flexible we made it completely plugin-based. The core is as thin as possible, so even features such as typing or support for paragraphs are plugins. Finally, the code is extremely modular and pedantically tested from day one (we always had and will have a 101% code coverage).

If that wasn't enough, we redesigned all features, rethought their UX and allowed developers to create their own UIs for the editor (BTW, React and Angular integrations are going to be released very soon).

As you can see I'm really proud of what we did and I could talk about that for hours :D. If you'd like to see the editor and test our take on real-time collaboration, see the links at the end of my comment. If you have any questions (e.g. why it's CKEditor 5 v11.0.0), I'll be glad to help.

Thanks for checking out <a href=""https://abrankings.com"">A/B Rankings, a split testing tool for SEO</a>!

I built this tool after years of making changes to my own sites without ever being sure of the true impact. I'd make a bunch of tweaks, see improvements but was never sure I was spending my time in the most efficient way.

Now, instead of blindly making 'best practice' improvements you can see which strategies really move the needle. By using your Search Console data we can accurately track the change in clicks, impressions and positions for a page and tell you if your test is statistically significant.

You can create a 'simple' title and description test, to try and optimize your site for higher click through rates and greater long tail keyword coverage, or create an advanced test using CSS Selectors to add, remove or change literally anything on your pages. 

Coming soon is a point and click editor for creating tests on your own website with no knowlege of selectors needed!

I hope you're excited as I am by the possibilities and would love to hear your feedback on my little project!

Thanks

@beedesignllc Hey Brandon, good questions :)
You're right - strictly speaking it is not pure A/B testing as you can only have one version of the page indexed at one time. Instead, for a single page test I run a 'paired t test' to calculate whether the test has a statistically significant impact. Alternatively you can test groups of pages to compare your candidates' results against a control group.

Google now renders Javascript and so the changes you make using A/B Rankings will be reflected in Google's index. However this can sometimes take an extra day or two after the page is crawled. 

I've also created plugins for Wordpress and Drupal, with more integrations to come, so that your site conducts the changes for a test before the content is even sent to the user. This avoids any rendering delay as Google sees the test right away.

Does that clear things up? Cheers :)
@pbriod Hey Pascal,
We do have the ability to monitor groups of pages and only subject a fixed percentage to a test, leaving you a control group to track changes against.
It's a little more involved than creating a single page test and I haven't written the documentation yet, but I'd be happy to walk you through if it helps?
Thanks :)

I have not one, but THREE episodes to share with you. 

The first episode is an interview with Ken Wallace of MastermindJam. Ken shares a lot of lessons about launching a new product, like: 
1. How to manage risk when you're putting time and money on the line
2. Why charging for your product from the very beginning, instead of giving it away for free, can sometimes build a more loyal base of first adopters, and
3. Why there is no ""there"" in entrepreneurship. 


In Episode 2, I sat down with Shelley Delaney at Orange Coworking, my favorite office-away-from-the-office in Austin, Texas.  Shelley has built an amazing sense of community into Orange Coworking, and we talk about why community is so important for solo founders and freelancers. 

Episode 3 is an interview with Brennan Dunn, who many of you will know from Double Your Freelancing and RightMessage. Brennan's story of how RightMessage evolved from the need to personalize marketing copy is really interesting.

Hey Product Hunt,

? The problem
While working with web development, you've probably found yourself scrolling inspect element a lot or looking for the computed styles tab on your browsers developer tools (and probably found some CSS properties that you've never heard before ?).

You maybe just want to get 1 thing from a framework, or are curious about what is the border-radius, box-shadow, etc of an element you just look on the internet.

‚úÖ The solution
This tool is faster than inspect element and give all of the styles in shorthand styles, this means no messy CSS or styles being overwritten. Want to copy? Cool, you just have to click!


? 3 Products in 3 Months
This is my last product of the challenge I made up for myself to ship 3 products in 3 months.

CSS Scan took me 50 hours and 17 minutes to develop. Inspired by @levelsio I ? recorded all the development and made a speed video. If you want to check it:
? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtsNNXpXcYs

? Features:
? Instantly check computed styles
? Click to copy
? Check the real size of elements
? Outline all elements
‚úã Ignore box-sizing or hover styles

? Price
I decided to price it as Pay what you want. ?

I would love to hear from you all how you can have a better experience using CSS Scan!

Cryptomeet is MVP so far, however it already offers one of the widest sets of markets and cryptocurrency pairs. Service is completely free.

Our additional features:
‚Ä¢ The transactional fees are specified at most markets and currency pairs.
‚Ä¢ An indication of the number of deals in the last hour allows evaluating the depth of an arbitrage window and this way to be convinced that the difference of cost of currencies can bring real profit.
‚Ä¢ The user may choose how to range opportunities of his interest. For this purpose there are filters by all important parameters: the exchanges, the number of transactions and spread.

In the nearest updates of service, there will be notification messages on the exposed filters (currencies, exchanges, volumes) and monitoring of opportunities of three currencies (so-called arbitrage triangles). This will expand the number of possible favorable trades as far as simplifying the search for a suitable deal for the specific trader.

Feel free to ask any questions and suggestions!

Meghan from Priizm here! We‚Äôre excited to launch Priizm on Product Hunt (and many thanks to @adamleidhecker for hunting us ?)! 

Priizm was built to democratize access and affordability to top business and life coaches. We believe in the power of coaching and that it should be on-demand, affordable, brief, and easy to access. Somewhere between your best friend and a therapist, a Priizm coach is an unbiased and professionally-trained sounding board, who can help you address daily challenges in any area of your life. 

I noticed a disturbing truth both in my professional and personal life over the past 18 years as I've faced a multitude of stress in my life from working in the high-paced advertising industry to having life-threatening complications during the birth of my first child. I relied on my foundation as a certified coach myself to navigate these difficult waters but I found it difficult to quickly access the ""space"" to process things with another person, which is the bedrock of coaching. I was lucky in that I knew I needed this resource; people are generally unprepared for dealing with life, or turn to therapy with the idea that they are somehow broken. In all the varieties of my challenges, I knew I didn‚Äôt need therapy, I needed a coach.

I was distraught at the coaching industry‚Äôs failure to provide access to top coaches at a moment‚Äôs notice. That this resource was mostly reserved for elite corporate levels. That coaches cater to this market with long-term commitment packages that cost thousands. In a fast-paced and on-demand world where we can view our bank account, order groceries or book an Uber with a touch of a button, I wanted to create a ‚Äúcustomer care line‚Äù for everyday life!

Priizm solves these problems and helps people achieve breakthroughs in any area, affordably, in 30 minutes. We understand that everyone needs to be truly heard and Priizm provides you with a skilled listener who will inspire you to unlock your potential. 

Priizm leverages a streamlined calling platform and our exclusive network of top coaches to anonymously and immediately connect you with an on-demand coach or schedule a call for a time that works for you. In 30 minutes, we‚Äôll get to the heart of the matter so you can get on with your day.

To celebrate our PH launch, we are offering the Product Hunt community a 20% discount off your first call. Enter the discount code: ProductHunt.

I‚Äôm excited for you to experience the Priizm difference and achieve your clarity!! Our top-quality Priizm Coaches are committed to helping you transform daily breakdowns into breakthroughs, transform your life and achieve your goals!

We‚Äôd love to get some feedback, and I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions. ?

Another project build without code :) A few years ago I had this idea to make a platform where event organizers could sell tickets and customers could safely resell their tickets. At the time it was too expensive to let it build... So now I finally build my idea (within 30 days and without Code).

Coode is a fraud-free event ticket service. When your customers buy an event ticket they will get access through their personal Coode. When a customer can‚Äôt go to your event they can sell their entrance. This way your customers can only get access to your events via Coode and you don‚Äôt have to deal with ticket fraud anymore. 

The best part is the event organizers are making 5% per second-hand ticket sold + tickets can only be sold for 20% more than bought.

Customers can buy a maximal of 6 tickets at a time. They can keep, resell or transfer the tickets to friends. When they choose to transfer a ticket the access goes from their Coode to the another Coode. 

At the door of your event, you can scan the Coode with your phone, tablet or laptop (No need for an extern QR-scanner). A customer can reset their Coode at any time, even right before scanning.

Coode is completely FREE to use we only charge your customers 0,55ct per ticket sold. We don‚Äôt take extra money on second-hand transactions other than the 0,55ct service-cost the event organizer takes the full 5%.";3;-2;True;True;False;web development

Thanks for your feedback!

The first stage of sharing is real time sync, which is already implemented and will be released soon (maybe already in the next version). Just wanted to keep this release manageable, in particular because server introduces ongoing costs and the pricing model is still TBD. 

In this stage you will be able to share with other users by logging in with the same account. This behaves the same as typical sharing, except that you don't see notifications (you just see the other user's actions) and of course it can be inconvenient when logging in with social media accounts.

The next stage - full-fledged sharing, with invites and notifications, is in early progress and will be released in a later version.";3;-2;True;True;False;community

To answer your questions: We are currently under development, with a planned beta test in September. It is compatible with any bar, they just have to sign up with our service and we'll get them set up. Yes! We've seen upwards of 30% increase in sales in the bars during our first concept testing. 

Thank you for your reply, if you have any other questions please feel free to ask.
@rahimiyosi Thank you for your feedback! Yes we do have a way to integrate with the bar's current POS system, Barkeep is supposed to serve as an extension of that. We are also working around with the coloration and design. Bar lighting is definitely tricky as it varies from bar to bar, and even within the bars themselves ( lights flashing, inconsistent lighting, etc.). We are working hard to find a good medium that is visually accessible in all types of lighting.

If you have any other questions please do not hesitate to ask!
@tostartafire Hi! Yes, I would understand not wanting to use the app if there weren't any locations near you. First, we are going to release our first phase of the app in Austin and Amsterdam and expand from there in our second phase. The on-boarding process is fairly simple (think GrubHub) and is easy to integrate any bar with little overhead and training. If you would like to suggest bars / cities that you would like to see just shoot me a message and I'll look into it!
@karimcmahon Hello! Yes, this is an issue. Questions are raised as to how this will affect the work load of the employees and if they're overwhelmed by something like this. You hit the point right on the dot! We are planning on implementing a system where we have designated areas, as well as support staff from Barkeep to help with facilitating the distribution of orders. As this is a new product we are always looking for solutions to improve the efficiency as well as streamlining the process as much as possible.

Optimally the bar should have a smooth transition and mix of online orders as well as physical orders with the Bartender. Barkeep should serve as an extension of the bar, not something just magically tacked on. Think of it as having a third arm, learning takes time but once you learn to use it the possibilities are great!";4;-3;True;True;False;community

Here is the story behind this little app:

The second quarter of 2018 was a crazy time for me. A hectic time at work, wedding preparations, and waiting for the honeymoon (the longest vacation I‚Äôve had during the last two years). On the one hand, I was feeling crushed by too many deadlines, on the other - I was just counting down the days to pack a suitcase and go to Bali ?.

So, I looked through the day counters on the App Store but couldn‚Äôt find anything satisfactory. And that‚Äôs why I developed CountdownBar ‚Äì my own pretty simple and minimalistic menu bar app. After coming back from my holidays, I‚Äôm still using it so, I decided to make it public.

Features:

- counts remaining days to a particular date
- possibility to choose an event that is visible on the menu bar
- possibility to add, remove, and edit your events
- optional launch on login

Hi Product Hunt,

I graduated college 2 years ago and have been an iOS Developer by profession since then, but I've always been interested in learning the web technologies. At work, I came across a workflow where I needed to move couple files about ~300MB multiple times to another computer. I didn't want to waste the storage space on Slack for transferring the files and couldn't set up Dropbox on that machine. 

? Solution
I made ShareFiles as my first web project where I could share the files/folders with anyone through a link that automatically expires after 24 hours. There probably exists multiple other products that can do this and has more features, but this was just a way for me to get my feet wet with some web technologies like Vue, Typescript, and Parcel for the past 2 months.

? Features:
- Drag n' Drop files/folders
- Files automatically zipped to conserve space and to speed up the process
- See all files and their respective sizes before uploading/downloading. 
- Links Management 
- No Registration
- <b>Free</b>

Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to answer them when I have a chance during work today!
@trolling42 Yup, it's on a remote server so that you don't have to be online or have your computer active when the other person wants to download the files.

This hunt is bit meta ?

Makers build more and more theirs products in public, sharing progress on Twitter, on Maker Goals or Wip Chat. 
But they also increase the chances to be hunted prematurely! ? (and we know how important a PH launch is nowadays...)

We discussed this problem on wip.chat yesterday after the product of a fellow maker was hunted too early?
We thought of one potential solution : Display a message on your product to avoid being featured by PH team!

So I built a small javascript that you can put in your landing page ?
It detects users coming from Product Hunt and let them know your product is not ready. And if everything goes well, the Product Team would remove the submission.? 

I hope this will help other makers keep control of their launch!

My name is David McNeill, and I have lived in the United States, China, Japan, and currently in Germany. When I moved from San Francisco to Tokyo and then to Berlin, I saw firsthand how unhelpful information on the Internet is when it comes to finding a job and settling in a new country. There are surface-level articles discussing working abroad scattered across the web, but there is no single resource for people to turn to for genuine, actionable tips and advice before, during and after moving to a city halfway across the world.

This is where my new website Expat Empire (expatempire.com) comes in. Expat Empire is singularly focused on providing the best quality content for new, experienced and soon-to-be expats around the world to make living and working abroad easier for everyone.

Expat Empire's first product is an eBook entitled Passport to Working in Japan that I have spent the last year researching, writing, and editing. The book focuses on my experience finding a job in Japan, moving to Tokyo, learning Japanese, adjusting to the Japanese work environment, and much more. It also includes advice from current expats and dozens of links to helpful resources to give readers the best chance to succeed in Japan.

The Expat Empire website and Passport to Working in Japan book are both launching today. Passport to Working in Japan is 25% OFF for the next week only, so don‚Äôt wait to pick up your copy! You can also subscribe to the Expat Empire newsletter to receive the first chapter for FREE!

Ever deal with large volume of PDF files and you have to add page numbers / watermark text to every page of it? I encountered this problem recently and decided to build a simple Mac app for it. You can simply drag and drop multiple PDF files on it and process in one go!

I've found many online service providing page numbering function for free but I am paranoid on what if they store the uploaded PDF and make it publicly available on some sketchy ebook downloading site? ?? (Some of them don't even have terms of service, might be just me being too paranoid)


I hope this app is useful for you!

Your feedback is highly appreciated! ?";4;-3;True;True;False;community

I‚Äôm building Indie Sponsor.

I‚Äôve been involved in marketing and growth for a long time now and a few issues among startups that always come up are ""how do we get new users?‚Äù or, ‚Äúhow do I tap into new groups of customers without breaking the bank?"". There are places like BuySellAds where you can buy/sell ads, however you‚Äôll need to shed a minimum of $5,000 to get started.

That‚Äôs why I created Indie Sponsor. A place where entrepreneurs and small biz owners can find opportunities to advertise and grow their customer base. Likewise, helping ‚Äúpublishers‚Äù or other businesses find people to pay for their advertising space on their platforms, like Newsletters, Podcasts, and more.

The goal is to connect these two sides of the market. Giving everyone equal access to the data, regardless if you‚Äôre starting up with a limited budget (business), or are more established (publisher) and want to sell unsold inventory.

At the moment we‚Äôre launching with just a few available opportunities in the form of a Newsletter, sent out every Sunday morning. But as the list grows, the network will get better and stronger over time.

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback. In particular, with format, and what other opportunity stuff would you like to see the information. You‚Äôll receive the first newsletter right after you sign up.

They have millions of followers and produce amazing content, but there was no safe space for kids to watch gaming content. On a positive note, we are working on a product dedicated to kids and gaming so all of the people we work with are fun, caring, and believe in our mission so the hard work is worth it. Remember, we exist so that kids can enjoy gaming videos and parents don‚Äôt have to worry about the next video or ad that may be inappropriate for their kid. 
Amazing question! At Tankee our team of real live humans is focused on gaming and screens ALL of the content which allows us to tackle issues unique to game content. With gaming there could be inappropriate content in chat boxes, in screen names, and the game content itself in addition to the narration from the gamers.

A big thanks to @tchret for hunting us!

I'm super excited to announce Zave. Save your most commonly used websites for personal reference or share them with the world!

I created Zave as I wanted to save and share my most commonly used websites, I found plenty of bookmarking tools but none that had a share option that allowed me to share (if I choose) content via a online profile. I see this a being a big bonus for Zave, I know I would love to see what the influential people in our community find useful and are reading on a daily basis. 

With Zave this is now an option, you can create a group (eg called reading list), make it public and share links to that group, these would then be visible to world via your Zave profile.

All groups and private by default but take just one click to make them public on your profile.

Road map:
- Browser extensions to make saving a website a one click process.
- Team accounts that would teams to invite team members and share websites privately or publicly. (How awesome would it be to see what bigger companies are reading and sharing with their teams!)

Enjoy!!
@binoyxj not at the moment I'm afraid, you can manually change the icon when saving but that could become time consuming when creating a large list.

Targeting the actual app icon on the AppStore is definitely something I can look at. ??

I'm Aswin Mohan the maker of NoPhone, an Android Launcher that is designed to keep you from wasting time on your phone, which helped a ton of people. It takes up your HomeScreen and slows down your access to those time wasting, distracting things(called Apps) on your phone, so you can focus on the things that matter :D


The Real 2.0 Story
When I launched NoPhone it was well received, it got a ton of up-votes and I got a ton of feedback on how to improve NoPhone (Feedback Rocks !!). I started implementing those features one by one and sadly because of how good I am at making stuff, crashes and bugs kept cropping in. The original became slow and bad and sad.

So I rewrote the entire thing in Android Native, which meant less size, more  performance and far less bugs and crashes.This is the product of  a month struggling to learn a new tech stack, gathering feedback and iterating on feature requests. 


The MARKETING 2.0 Story
I was sleeping on my couch when two angels came down and gave me this AWESOME idea and a magic potion to make NoPhone more awesome. So I gathered an awesome team, raised a gazillion dollars in funding and made this which will CHANGE THE WORLD, MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE, RANDOM CATCH PHRASE HERE.

You'll get access to the curriculum with various topics, recommendations, tutorials, links to help you at various stages of building your startup.

The first stage is live especially for signups from PH and more content will be released from August 1st. 

Let's get building!
@neilcocker 30 days ?

Ha well the first group of signups, content will be released based on a 30 day timeframe... but you can go as slow as you like really. 

After all content is released from the first 30 day cohort, you could essentially run through all the stages in a week. 

I want this to become something that people start and finish whenever they want but to get people launching. It will hopefully become a continuous challenge.
@neilcocker Yeah I recommend at least 30 mins per day. All the recommendations are based on zero code so shouldnt be unrealistic
@bentossel @dosney cheers!
@leandro8209 Cheers! All pointing to the same goal for sure

Hello Product Hunters! 

I‚Äôm a UI/UX designer and I often find myself installing new apps to check out the design and how they do certain product flows. I then take a bunch of screenshots for future reference. Over time I found screenshots limiting because:
* With static screens, it's hard to visualize full product flows
* The best apps use animations and microinteractions in interesting ways that screenshots just can't capture
* They would get lost in my camera roll and were hard to find when I needed them


To solve this, I've curated over 200+ interactions and have another 100+ apps lined up that I'll be adding over the next couple weeks. 

You can browse by pattern (Onboarding, Inviting friends, Ask permissions etc.) or by App. You can even search if you're looking for something specific that isn't tagged.

Would love to hear your feedback and how I can improve this to be more useful for you. Cheers!

I'm really excited to share OctoSearch with you.

As a developer, I spend a lot of time on GitHub to explore the open sources. When I look at a project, I often click on the Stars button to see if any of my following starred the project. That's because I trust my following so their stars are valuable to me. Repeating that action over and over again I come up with an idea to build a tool to search from starred repositories by following users and that is OctoSearch. 

Please give it a try if you are a GitHub user. Happy to hear any suggestions you might have!

I am Vamshi, author of this book:

Design Patterns - I came across this term for the first time in my life in a job interview (mind you, I was almost two years into iOS Development then). I got back home and googled about them. It was embarrassing and interesting at the same time, as I found out that I had been using a few of those patterns without actually realising that I was doing so.
I forgot about that incident after several days and got back to my work. Fast forward two years, I was back at job searching and this time I decided to learn in depth about design patterns. As a seasoned iOS Developer, I was initially looking to learn the concepts through examples coded in Swift language.
Surprisingly, I could not find a single book or blog discussing design patterns in detail in the Swift language. There are tons of books and blogs discussing them in Java, C#, PHP, etc.
For someone who codes in Swift, it only takes a little effort to understand Java. So, I started learning the design patterns from different sources available on the Internet through Java examples. For practice, I started putting up a few examples in Swift for each of the design patterns.
Personally, cricket is something that I understand in and out. I can almost relate anything under the sun to a situation in cricket (okay, that‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration).
So, I decided, instead of using different contexts for each of the design pattern examples, I would be using cricketing terms for all the examples I would be coding. I believe cricket is a very simple game, and even for those who do not follow the game, it should not be a big effort to relate to the cricketing terms.";2;-3;True;True;False;creativity

Tilda Icons allow designers or website owners to save money by using our free icons instead of order icons for their projects from illustrators. 

All icons have the same universal flat style and you can modify them easily. All together they are a coherent whole. For sure you can find icons on the internet when you creating a website for a yoga studio or something else, but there is a chance that they belong to different authors and have a different style.

Cons: We want to be able to tidy up the room. More later. We also want deeper character development. More later. We're working on it.
@abadesi Thank you ! It's been a journey! I've been in the games industry for 15 years. I'm originally an AI programmer. And over those years I was growing increasingly frustrated as I saw game design theory cement around concepts of stress and mastery and leave behind the parts I like--caretaking, characters, story.

After an interesting conversation with a friend who doesn't like video games, I dug into the psychology behind player motivation and discovered a theory in the field of stress psychology that succinctly explains why I find stress and mastery boring and why I want these other things. This theory may explain why of 5bn mobile users, there are only 2.2bn mobile gamers. The games industry is ignoring the tastes and desires of about half of people. 

(I would extrapolate from that to say that the tech industry in general suffers from an analogous issue in its approach to app design.)

Around this time I met Eve Thomas, artist and writer and my co-designer for this app. She's not interested in video games, and I'm an expert in video games, so we make great creative partners. We decided to work together to try to make something different, something that is built not on stress and FOMO but on care and connection. 

It was Eve's idea to focus the app specifically around the topic of self-care. She's a fan of the idea of the digital detox and of good mental health habits. But we both know that making detox the ideal is setting us all up to fail and to feel even worse... we will all be growing more and more connected over time, not less. Voice interfaces and mixed reality are coming. 

So we're working with Dr. Isabela Granic and her team at the Games for Emotional and Mental Health lab at Radboud to make something that helps us to feel calm, connected, invigorated, and that we naturally put down after a few minutes ready to face our lives again.";3;-4;True;True;False;creativity

I am co-creator of ProofCafe. After running ProofCafe beta for past five months that saw users from US, EU, Australia, South American countries and India among others, signing up for beta and helped us with their feedback to make ProofCafe more useful. TY!

Today I am thrilled to introduce ProofCafe for PH community.

How ProofCafe will make life easier for designer
1. Simply share creative content with team, client
2. Invite reviewers and approvers to provide review comments
3. Clients can mark their review comment right on top of the image, pdf, video
4. Upload multiple versions of your creative work
5. Clients will always be referring to latest copy of the work, avoiding any confusion
6. Clients can compare two different versions side-by-side and highlight differences

Basically you don't have to do the frustrating search through emails, spreadsheet, meeting details or attachments to get feedback/approval for your creative work. ProofCafe gives you one place for upload, share, review comment and approval.

How is it different?
It is simple to use, no learning curve. Even the workflow to get reviews, approvals from different department is pretty simple. Clients do not require separate login to view/review/approve your artwork.

What's next?
We plan to integrate ProofCafe with Adobe CC, support additional file types, integration with youtube, vimeo, dropbox, slack and other tools that designers use frequently.

Konstantin, the developer of ShutterCheck here!

Nowadays a lot of people are engaged in digital photography. Some are satisfied with the capabilities of theirs iPhone camera, but those who want to go further buy themselves a full-featured DSLR cameras like Canon EOS series. The modern DSLR camera is a complex and expensive device that costs a couple of thousands dollars, take the EOS 5D Mark IV for example. Some people who can‚Äôt afford to purchase a new item choose to buy a previously owned camera.

If you are familiar with digital photography you may know that today‚Äôs DSLR cameras still feature a mechanical shutter in front of a sensor. Every time you take a photo shutter blades are actuated to control the exposure of your image. Modern cameras have shutter mechanisms that are rated for something about 100,000-400,000 actuations (the actual value depends on camera class: entry-level or professional). That‚Äôs called a shutter rated lifespan and it stands for a number of guaranteed ‚Äòclicks‚Äô that you can make with your camera until the shutter wears out and replacement would be needed. If you buy a secondhand camera you should probably want to know its shutter count because it‚Äôs like a mileage of a used car! But it turns out, there is no way to check shutter count of a Canon EOS camera except maybe taking it to a service center for a diagnostic.

I‚Äôve spent five months reverse-engineering Canon EOS cameras and made ShutterCheck app that is now capable of reading shutter actuations count from 65 Canon EOS models, including the recent additions to the lineup, such as EOS 1D X Mark II, 5D Mark IV, 5DS and 6D Mark II. For newer devices an extended shutter information is also available: besides plain shutter count you‚Äôll get separate values for photos taken through the viewfinder, photos taken via the Live View and a number of Live View sessions. ShutterCheck displays shutter count along with a shutter‚Äôs rated lifespan so you can easily see the percent of its wear.

I believe ShutterCheck would be a great helper when making deals on preowned cameras because it allows you to easily estimate/verify value of a previously used item in order to make quick and hassle-free business.

During the launch the app is available for a reduced price of $2.99.

Let me know what you think about my product. Thanks!";3;-2;True;True;False;community

I'm the maker of GoldenChaos-BTT - a complete Touch Bar UI replacement made with BetterTouchTool that you can use right now with no special config needed.

I *love* the Touch Bar. That's why I was so upset that Apple just sat on its botched its user interface. So, inspired by popular blog posts on the subject, and determined to make good on the promise that Apple broke, I spent a (ridiculous) amount of time reworking the foundations of the Touch Bar into GoldenChaos-BTT.

GoldenChaos-BTT is a true general purpose Touch Bar UI with support for tons of apps. It's intuitive enough to make you love your Touch Bar again - or, more likely, for the first time. You might even start to miss it on keyboards that don't have it. Over the last two months since the launch of the BetterTouchTool community sharing site, it's become the single most popular BetterTouchTool preset. And it's developer verified, too!

Download GoldenChaos-BTT from the thread and let me know what you think, I'm constantly improving it ? and if you want to contribute scripts for additional app support, please join the thread - the more people that get involved, the better!

Cheers all!
@wowthatisrandom wow, thank you! That means a lot. Also, I didn't realize you were the developer of Forecastbar! Big fan of your apps. I should *probably* check them for keyboard shortcut conflicts...

I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface of the Touch Bar's true potential, too, even after so many hours of work. I really don't know how Apple screwed this up, haha.";5;-3;True;True;False;creativity

We started Rewardful to make it simple and affordable for bootstrappers and early-stage SaaS companies to setup affiliate and referral programs.

Current affiliate software is expensive, clunky, and usually handles subscription billing as an after-thought. Rewardful is affordable, ultra simple, and focuses exclusively on subscription-based billing with Stripe. Just connect with Stripe, drop in a few lines of code, and you're all set.

We want referral marketing to be available to companies of all sizes, so we‚Äôve included a performance-based pricing plan starting at $0. There‚Äôs no fixed fee ‚Äî you pay nothing until your affiliate program is profitable, which removes the biggest barrier to getting started.

Here‚Äôs a highlight of some of Rewardful‚Äôs best features so far:

‚úÖCustomer lifecycle tracking built for subscription billing: We handle recurring commissions, trial periods, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and refunds.
‚úÖDeep Stripe integration with our two-way Stripe sync: We make Rewardful data easily accessible directly from your Stripe dashboard, and everything in Rewardful links back to Stripe.
‚úÖSimple, clean URL parameters that link directly to your root domain (ie. getrewardful.com?via=justin). No ugly redirects or 3rd party subdomains.
‚úÖLink to any page on your domain. No need to generate a new affiliate link.
‚úÖAffiliate link A/B testing: affiliates can create as many vanity URLs as they want, allowing them to measure the effectiveness of different marketing channels
‚úÖReminder emails when it‚Äôs time to pay affiliates

We have a LOT of other cool stuff waiting in the pipeline too ‚Äî stay tuned!

? To celebrate our launch on Product Hunt, we‚Äôre offering the first 6-months free for anyone that signs up and installs before August 31. Note: you need to click the Product Hunt link or follow this URL to activate the offer: https://www.getrewardful.com/?via=product-hunt

@bradycassidy @lenmarkidan Thanks Len! It's only going to get better too ?
@sethlouey ?Neat apps! Give us a shout, would love to hook you up.
@bilalbudhani To be honest it was a lot more work than I was expecting at first, haha! Unfortunately we don't have any immediate plans to integrate with Paddle, sorry ?But it's something we might consider for the future.
@bilalbudhani By the way, Paddle has their own built-in affiliate feature. However, there's almost no information about it on their website, and I've heard from a couple Paddle users that it's extremely basic with limited functionality. Have you checked it out?
@weirdowizard Thanks for the kind words Darshan :)
@brendonrell Interesting! It's long been a thorn in my spine, which is why I finally just rage-built my own ?Interesting you mentioned coupons in that thread ‚Äî that's something we're in the planning stages of right now (ex: auto-apply coupons to referred customers). Give me a shout on Intercom or kyle@getrewardful.com if you want to chat more!
@rstankov @rrhoover @bradycassidy We'd love to chat to learn more about your goals and see if there's a way we can help ?
@paulmckeever Awesome to hear Paul, give us a shout if there's anything we can do to help get your affiliate program rolling!
@justinotherjohnson Good question ‚Äî right now we're more oriented around ""affiliates"", i.e. people (who may or may not be customers) you reward with cash. But ""referrals"", i.e. customers who are rewarded with credits for referring other customers is definitely in the roadmap.  The mechanics are very similar.

(By the way, not sure if my distinction between ""affiliates"" and ""referrals"" makes sense, but it's how we've been talking about them internally)

> Are there an examples of the upgrade logic other apps have used?

Not entirely sure I understand. You mean that because your goal is to grow free users, you'd like some incentive structure that doesn't involve rewarding with cash or credit?
@mariordev Thanks Mario :) Give us a shout if you'd like to try it out.
@ramykhuffash Thank you! Hven if you're not *quite* at the stage where you need an affiliate program, it might be worth signing up & installing now so you lock in our 6 months free offer for Product Hunters. ?
@cesc_vilanova Thank you!

Technically it will work with any Invoice generated by Stripe, whether that's a subscription invoice, an invoice created through the API, or an invoice created directly in the Stripe dashboard.

However, my guess is that Typeform creates Charges (not Invoices) which Rewardful currently doesn't support. We've talked about supporting charge, but it's not something we'll do for sure.

For a while now I've been a big fan of ZEIT and their deployment platform <a href=""https://now.sh"">Now</a>. It has great CLI, Desktop and Web experiences, however aside from web version of the dashboard, there wasn't quite anything available for mobile.
And I'm very mobile, and I imagine a lot of people with similar lifestyle are as well, so I decided to fill this gap :)

?Ô∏è <b>Solution</b>

As such, I built <a href=""https://mobile.now.sh"">Now Mobile</a> - an app that lets you keep an eye on your Now deployments easily.
What exactly can it do? 

? <b>Features</b>

- Event history
- Deployments view
- Active aliases
- Domains with Now CDN status
- Usage statistics to date
- Teams support
- Spotlight search
- Touch ID / Face ID
- Today widgets (Instances, Usage)
- Apple Watch app (including Watch face complications)

All of ZEIT's own client apps are open source, so it's only fair this one would be as well. <a href=""https://github.com/rdev/now-mobile"">And it is!</a> Contributions are welcome :)

@iamtekeste It's on my todo list. It's basically ready to go (without the Watch and Today widgets of course), but from my past experience with React Native there are always minor issues here and there you need to work out on Android and since I don't have a physical device to test properly I decided to focus on iOS for v1.0.0.

HoloBack is an exploration in art ?, communication ‚òéÔ∏è, and fun ?!  Expect some social features, interactive and persistent holograms, and more in the coming months!

Looking forward to hearing any feedback!
- Alex  ?????
@rrhoover What a great idea!  Something worth exploring for sure!
@stepheninoue Thanks for the feedback, couldn‚Äôt agree more!  Object placement in mobile AR is a challenging and still developing area of UX‚Äî I hope a few simple improvements (such as wording in the steps, that‚Äôs great feedback!) and best practices here can make the experience much better.
@swatiraina2 Thanks, glad you like it!  Hope your friends will try it out too! ?

After a lot of work, I am thrilled to launch Pair &amp; Compare on Product Hunt.

<strong>Why? (The Problem)</strong> ‚ö†Ô∏è
Pair &amp; Compare came from a need I experienced during web development and design. Whenever I wanted to choose a great-looking font (or font-pair) for my website or my blog, I would start a tedious process of searching for a font (especially from Google Fonts), then editing my code, and then seeing the results in the browser, and repeating that.
This is bearable, but the problem get worse when I want to compare different fonts (or font-pairings) on the same page, so I can see which one is better. From these needs, comes..

<strong>Pair &amp; Compare (The Solution)</strong> ?
Pair &amp; Compare is a web application that lets you find the best fonts and font-pairings for your next project easily and smoothly. It is a font playground.

<strong>Features</strong>
? Try all Google Fonts (800+ fonts) on your text: without downloading or installing any of them without copying and pasting font names, without adding and editing HTML link tags, without switching windows or refreshing browsers; without the hassle. But with just a click.
? Not just Google fonts. You can also add and use fonts from your device.
? Pair fonts easily and quickly.
? Compare many fonts (or font pairings) on the same page.
? Control a lot of settings: font size, color, background color, text width, line height, etc, fast and smoothly.
? Explore fonts in the easiest way with Font Show feature.
? Change any text you want. Apply changes to all other texts with a click.
? Get CSS code of your chosen setting.
? Bookmark fonts while experimenting to decide later between them.
? Clean interface (hide the sidebar for a cleaner one).
? It is Free.
? All languages are supported.
Thank you @chrismessina for hunting Pair & Compare
I am ready to answer your questions on Pair & Compare and to hear your opinion about it ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
@gurpreetkaur01 Thank you
The main purpose of creating Pair & Compare is what you just described.

I'm really happy to share my new project, PassportSimple.

?What is it?

We all know at least a friend or a family member who had a trip ruined because he/she forgot to renew his/her passport. Most countries ask for at least 6 months of passport validity after your return day to let you in, so your passport could still be valid but not enough to travel. 

PassportSimple is a service that sends you a reminder 7 months before the end of your passport for you not to forget to renew it! 

?Who is behind PassportSimple?

Me :) As you can see on my ProductHunt profile, I already launched http://traveloffers.email (a service that sends you monthly emails with the best flight offers from your city). I'm also a PMM at iAdvize and a (small) investor at Numa, Revolut, Monzo and Clever Cloud.


?Do you make money with that?

I think that PassportSimple is really valuable since it can help you save your holidays. But since it's a really simple tool, it's only $5 per reminder. It will help me run the service in the long term and build other tools in the future :)

?What are the next steps?

Well, we first want to have your feedbacks and see if you like it :) Then, I'm sure there are other services we can add to help you even more :)

?Can't wait to read your feedback and to answer to your questions!
@alexfu914 That‚Äôs basically the case for almost every online service :) Why paying for Dropbox when you could build your own storage and sharing server? Or you just click and it‚Äôs done :)
@cenk No service can guaranty that, but I rely on Google services to store the email and expiry date so even if my website goes down, the email can still be sent :)";3;-2;True;True;False;creativity

I really love listening to podcasts. But I've noticed most podcast hosts don't know what they need to do to grow their audience. I hear so many hosts recommend listeners subscriber ""wherever you download podcasts"" without giving the listener a clear path forward. Hopefully this little side project will make that a bit easier.
@jonbstrong If there's an API I can hit to get the SoundCloud URL, then I could probably figure it out. Otherwise, it would have to be a premium feature for shows that claim a custom URL. (That's on my current roadmap for platforms like Spotify and Stitcher)
@rrhoover Hey there,

I'm actually hitting the iTunes lookup API with every keystroke. Sometimes that causes a jamup. The path of my URL is the the iTunes ID. So you can reverse engineer any of my pages.

Here's the ones you mentioned:
https://pod.link/862714883
https://pod.link/315114957
@keirwilliams That's something I need to look into. It's an ""all rectangles aren't squares"" problem. I know I can provide valid links if I key off the iTunesID, but not necessarily if I key off the feed URL.
@andreaspizsa Thanks, I'll get that implemented!

With ScreenTime, we're going after more casual use cases like shopping on amazon, viewing photos together, picking the right AirBnB, helping dad figure out technology etc, as opposed to  heavy duty uses cases like long conference calls or tech support (after all, most people use FaceTime to chat with family and friends). 

In the last week alone, I've FaceTime-ed my brother with ScreenTime and helped him fix his linker errors on Xcode, helped him pick a pair of sunglasses for my mom on SunglassHut and decided on the hotel we're going to stay at during our Christmas vacation in Singapore this winter. (I must mention, we live half way around the world from each other.)
@astghik_azaryan It depends what you use FaceTime for, to be honest. Pretty much my whole extended family buys Apple, so we use FaceTime pretty often. FaceTime plays a big part in our lives. So, when I'm talking to my granny and she complains about nobody having shown her my 2 yr old niece's latest photos on IG, I pull up ScreenTime and show them to her. Some other day, I might be checking in on my brother, and he might have a question or two for me about C++. So, ScreenTime really helps in situations like these where, mid conversation, you decide you want to show the other person a photo, or a webpage or a demo of some sort.

Now whether it's worth $10, that's for you to decide. I must mention, I have a generous trial in place, so there's no risk in taking the app out for a spin. The trail is unlimited and lets you screen share for up to a minute per call.
@ayush_chandra Thank you. Unfortunately, we piggy back on FaceTime for the video conferencing side of things, and the tech. is deeply tied to macOS. So, as much as I'd like for this to work on Windows, that'll sadly be a no go. I'm really sorry :(
@etc What kind of pricing would you be most comfortable with? I'm all ears :)
@joid Messages.app screensharing only works across macs, so mac->mac. ScreenTime, on the other hand, can be used mac -> iOS device.";3;-3;True;True;False;community

Metaphysics aside, Set in Block is a useful tool for a wide range of use cases. Someone can make a promise to oneself or a beloved one. In politics, a public statement can be made.

Hi @johnyoung1985 ?Ô∏è,

You pay me for the submission process. The true question: Is it useful to send this list? Look at the list and decide yourself. 

But as an old filmmaker says, you can make a bad movie with a good scenario, but you can not make a good movie with a bad scenario.

So, how we make the sending process more efficient. Firstly it takes a month. Sending all this place in a day impossible. 

Each community is unique. We can not reach everybody in the same way. 

Please reach me for the more specific questions serhadiletir@gmail.com
@bentossell We do not charge for submitting PH. We charge for a time-consuming task. 

The reason I build Submit Checklist is that create a feedback generator. For this reason, the sending process takes a month.

@codyfitzpatrick great point!  Yes, you can download the first chapter for free on the book's site here: https://growthmarketersplaybook.com/
Yes, the online workshop goes into more detail on how to actually apply the principles from the book and it has more case studies not mentioned in the book.  I learn much better from examples so I put more in the online workshop.
@codyfitzpatrick ha - i think that also means we need to lay out the landing page better. Nothing on the calendar for Miami yet but I would jump at anything that pops up.  Love it down there.

This basically is an easy way to build a community website. A community website is something that includes a newsfeed, messages, profiles pages, events/groups etc. 

I built this initially for a client who was using Whatsapp and FB groups to manage her community. But decided to build a community website builder as this will be useful for more people - alumni networks, startup incubators, co-working spaces and niche community groups. 

It's in Beta as I want to slowly introduce more communities but the product is ready. If you have any questions, do let me know. Happy to show you a free trial for anyone running a community. 

Thanks!

Thanks @rrhoover. Discourse is great but mainly for community forums. Mighty Networks is also really good. I did download their app, and their on-boarding process and UI is so clean and easy.. Haven‚Äôt really looked at Spectrum yet. I initially built this for a client - and the specific use case they had was not met by the ones you mentioned. 

Just to mention a few:

1. They wanted a central newsfeed somewhat similar to how Twitter was but for their community.
2. The client wanted to promote each community members skills. Each community member‚Äôs skills (e.g writer, programmer etc) and each community members company services (e.g architect, Travel agency) had to be made visible and easily found via search, so that their community members also use the platform to get more work for themselves or their company. 
3. Community events are also a little different. Both community members and non-members can attend events

Both @boaticus and you are right with the name being too generic. I initially went for this as each business which creates a community gets their own subdomain (e.g nike.joincommunity.io) - and that made sense if they promoted it to their customers. But I assume most businesses will host this under their own website - eg community.nike .com

Bootstrapping this and my initial priority is just to do sales / cold calls / offline meets and sell to 100 communities first. Right now SEO, branding isn‚Äôt that important for this very early phase. Ken, really good points. Definitely have to think on this more ! Thanks.";3;-2;True;True;False;web development

We want to make discovering bundles fun again, while offering great value for money on some of the best resources around. ;3;-1;True;False;False;Long;Medium;No;No;The 'Bundle-Only' marketplace for creatives;Medium;No;No;No;No;0;No;No;Yes;89651;Liam McKay;Yes;Yes;Low;Few;Yes;89651;Liam McKay;Yes;Yes;Low;Yes;"@marcperel Thanks for the kind words, I certainly had fun on the re-design and it's great to give new life to something that's been around for 6 years or more! 

To answer some of your questions: 
‚è∞ Instead of submitting items, we hand-pick the creators that we work with and then give them full control of their store, their bundles and their prices. The effort goes in to finding the right people, rather than nit-picking each and every item that comes through. My focus is on adding new sellers only when they are a good fit, rather than racing to sign up as many new shops as we can. New sellers can apply too though & that approval process shouldn't take any more than 24 hours.
? As for promotion, we have an active subscriber list of around 25k+ people that we can utilise to get the right products in front of the right people. Alongside this we also have our larger monthly bundle promotions, giveaways and freebies which should help grow the audience for the marketplace too.
? The awesome artwork for each listing comes down to picking the right sellers and trusting that they are the best people to showcase their products. I've worked in this space for many years and I try to use everything I've learnt over the years when deciding who to work with. I'm personally on hand to help seller make any tweaks or improvements to their listings if needed too. We can remove any items that don't quite fit, but I don't foresee that bring a problem so long as I keep reaching out to the right sellers.

Cheers for checking the new direction & thanks for the thoughtful questions Marc!
@chocksy Thanks for the support, great to have submissions coming in too. I'll take a look!
@devinrajaram Great to hear you were an early user back in the day, thanks for the question Devin! Basically I want to make Dealotto the destination for bundles, and bulk-buying resources without anything else getting in the way. Essentially making it the easiest place to pick up lots of assets at once safe in the knowledge that the quality is always there. Beyond that, I want to work on ways to make it easier for sellers to monetise their hard work (subscriptions etc) while keeping it fun for buyers too.
@surjithctly Dealotto was always a side-project of mine, and without a marketplace element it always relied heavily on a lot of behind-the-scenes work that was prone to hold ups, mistakes and problems that impacted how often bundles could go out. Each bundle used to be put together by me, with lots of moving parts, and lots of things that could go wrong, they so often did. This meant lots of time fixing issues and fighting fires, taking time away from actually posting bundles. In short, the process wasn't suited to the time I had to give it, and we got unlucky with a lot of things outside of our control.

I always kept the site ticking over in the background as I knew that one day I could find the time to fix all of the problems with the flow so that the site could be more self-sufficient and smoother to run. So fuelled by lots of ideas and a love for the scene it was only a matter of time before I found the time and effort to fix it up, now here we are and I couldn't be happier!

I had a lovely time working at Creative Market, and even helped them set up their own bundle system in my time there, but I left my position there a couple of years ago now. Thanks!

Having recently left my full time job, I had the spare time & opportunity to focus on what to do next.

Individual's security and privacy is an area that I am very passionate about, so I created Magic Lasso to help people ensure they are safe and secure when using the internet. 

Magic Lasso was developed to provide a counterpoint to advertising on the internet and to put control and power back into the hands of individual users. It‚Äôs a small step towards solving the problems with advertising, privacy and security.

More on the reasons for launching the app can be read in our post ‚Äú<a href=""https://www.magiclasso.co/insights/problem-with-ads-internet-inevitable-rise-adblocking/"">The problem with internet ads</a>‚Äù 

I hope this is a tool PH‚Äôs will love to use everyday.
@anna_0x Our goal is to create the most user-friendly and platform-native iOS and macOS adblocker available. A few reasons why Magic Lasso is better than some other alternatives: 
‚Äì Our ad blocking technology uses the native and supported iOS and macOS Safari content blocking APIs. This means the blocking is very efficient, we we don't have access to browsing history and these APIs will have ongoing support by Apple in the future. Some other adblockers utilise VPN based ad blocking or other browser extension mechanisms which allows tracking of visited web pages, can have security issues, and is not supported by Apple on iOS. 
‚Äì We have very strict privacy and security policies and cannot see any web pages that our user's visit. We do not store any user data or have a data-based business model. 
‚Äì Our app is completely user funded and not advertiser funded (unlike some other adblockers such as Adblock Plus). This means we can make product decisions that are better for our users and subscribers as opposed to advertisers.
‚Äì  We are continually improving both the ad-blocking rules (on average we release a new update at least every week) and apps for both iOS and macOS. Since soft-launching we've quickly iterated and released over 20 app updates in less than 12 months.
‚Äì Standard ad-blocking functionality is, and will always be, free. We have optional Pro features which support our ongoing development and provide some more advanced functionality for those users who want that level of control.

Thank you for your interest - I hope you give it a try to see if it suits you better than some other options available.
@omtnt As you note our standard ad blocking functionality is free. Our goal is to make the best ad blocker available for the iPhone, iPad and Mac with continual updates, a great UX and valuable features.

To be able to do this we need to be funded and sustainable somehow. The optional Pro subscription enables us to continue to develop the product and provide it for free for users who can't afford it or don't see the value (yet) to subscribe.

So the subscription both supports ongoing development and provides extra functionality such as automated daily background updates. We've got lots of great additional Pro features planned in upcoming releases too.

Not all 'free' alternatives are as transparent about their funding model. Open-source approaches are good, but some approaches are funded by advertisers ‚Äì in these cases these apps actually let some advertising to be displayed (as long as they've been paid by those particular advertisers).

We hope that our funding model aligns our incentives with that of our users.";4;-3;True;True;False;community
132626;BitMidi;1.0;3;Yes;138;09/08/2018;09/08/2018 02:03:57;Thursday;Yes;No;No;In the days of Geocities and Angelfire, a quirky HTML tag called < bgsound > enabled sound files to play in the background of webpages. Usually, these files were in the MIDI format. What a glorious era that was! Sadly, ÔºúbgsoundÔπ• has been removed from browsers and MIDI is obscure and hard to play back. UNTIL NOW! Check out BitMidi! ‚ú®;3;-2;True;True;False;Long;Short;No;Yes;üéπ The wayback machine for old-school MIDI files;Medium;Yes;No;No;No;0;No;No;No;1379615;Feross Aboukhadijeh;Yes;Yes;Low;Few;Yes;1379615;Feross Aboukhadijeh;Yes;Yes;Low;Yes;"Hey folks! So, the context for this site is that I was reminiscing about the days of Geocities and Angelfire, back when the web was quirky and fun. I remembered how sites used to use the ÔºúbgsoundÔπ• HTML tag to include an autoplaying background MIDI file. Those files had such a nice, old-school aesthetic.

I wanted to hear some MIDIs, so I searched and found a .zip file with 100K+ MIDI files that someone posted to Reddit. I tried playing a few in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. and then realized that they've all dropped the ÔºúbgsoundÔπ• tag. Even Quicktime and VLC couldn't play back the files.*

There were some websites that could convert MIDI to low-quality MP3, and technically Apple still offers Quicktime 7 for download which can play MIDI, but it wasn't easy or fun to do.

Some websites offered inline playback with Flash (but it was flaky and hard to get working in Chrome), and the JS-based ones were missing many instruments or multi-MB Emscripten-compiled monstrosities!

I decided that I'd compile the best MIDI player written in C (libtimidity) to WebAssembly and put in lots of effort to optimize the bundle and include the minimal amount of code. The result of that is here: https://github.com/feross/timidity It's quite lightweight - just 34 KB of JavaScript and 23 KB of lazy-loaded WebAssembly.

Then I put a frontend on it, so it's easy to browse that .zip file's contents. And that's BitMidi.

I plan to ingest a lot more MIDI files in the future, perhaps from the Geocities MIDI archive on the Internet Archive.

Feedback welcome!

* I later learned that VLC can actually play most MIDIs and I just got unlucky with the few I tried! That's okay though ‚Äì I got to learn a lot about MIDI files, Emscripten, WebAssembly, and modern front-end web techniques. And I made a cool site too :)
@ruimramos Yep, docking the player so you can control play/pause/prev/next while still browsing is a great idea. Working on it!

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that can significantly bolster recall. Once I discovered it, I knew I'd found the solution to my problem. 

Yak Tack is simple. Simply email ""word@yaktack.com"" with a word you'd like to remember. Or type it into the search box on yaktack.com to get started.

We are launching this because we think that a lot of makers are building cool products because they enjoy it - not because they want to raise a bunch of venture capital. For people making products on the side, a small amount of cash is awesome. 

On the other hand, a lot of people with Silicon Valley aspirations don't have the resources or network to get there very easily. A small amount of money can be life-changing. 

I hope in some way this simple program will inspire makers everywhere - regardless of background, connections, or resources.

I am very happy to release the new version of canSnippet CE today. canSnippet Community Edition is a web-based snippet management tool. It allows you to save and share all the precious pieces of code and text that you often refer to. The whole story started during my PhD when I often needed to get the list of all hexamer sequences (4096 sequences of 6 letters) as a Python array. Instead of writing the function every time in different project or creating limited access functions I was simply copy-pasting these few lines of code to all the scripts that needed this information. I then decided to implement a code snippet manager to make my life easier. Today, I use canSnippet for anything from a single hexstring for colors in CSS to complete functions to repetitive text for emails. 

canSnippet CE was born in 2013, followed by a little desktop brother in 2017 (https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cansnippet) and a completely new version 2.0.0 coming out today. The main advantage of the desktop version is the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to have your snippets always in your hands. 

canSnippet CE is a complete content management system for your repetitive code and text. The main features of canSnippet are as follow:
- easily share your snippets with a unique URL
- multiple user accounts
- syntax highliting
- tags support
- copy the snippet to your clipboard with a button
- rating system
- multiple themes 

You can follow the whole project via:

- Github: https://github.com/ademcan/canSnippet
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/cansnippet

I'm @mkarnicki and this is my first ever product launch. Stackdraft is fully bootstrapped and I've dedicated the last 6 months, literally all of my time and most of my savings to make this project a reality. I'm equally excited and nervous to share it with you all :) ?!

Mid February this year I wanted to draw a nicely looking cloud architecture of the project I was working on at the time. Most of the ""flat"" diagramming software out there didn't really impress me and the only one that looked clean was fixed on a different cloud provider than I intended to use at the time. It was also fixed to the isometric projection (which some users liked, others didn't). Reading feedback on different diagramming solutions I could easily tell I wasn't the only one looking for such a tool for other cloud/infrastructure providers as well, like Google Cloud Platform or DigitalOcean. Hence, inspired by both the good sides and limitations of other solutions, I decided to try create my own. And that's how Stackdraft was created.

The project is in <b>Beta</b>, that's why the pricing page lists a plan titled <i>Early Adopters</i>. I'm looking for a limited number of folks (at most 300), who for a heavily discounted monthly subscription price will help me polish the product and shape its future features. I have a ton of ideas for the product, but it's time to verify with the market.

There is a famous quote by Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn: <i>If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.</i>

So here I am! More than happy to answer your questions :). Thank you for checking out Stackdraft!";4;-3;True;True;False;community

I created ZenJournal to scratch my own itch: I often have random ideas, private thoughts, and personal reflections that don‚Äôt really suit any existing social media. I wanted to find an extremely simple and fluid way to log these. Typical journal or note taking apps are usually feature rich beasts that‚Äôs nothing but fast and fluid, with many wasted white space and a stressful blank new journal entry view that doesn‚Äôt align well with how I normally journal. I liked how Slack grouped all recent messages in one group as long as your message is typed within 5 minutes of last message. My habit of journaling micro fleeting multiple-times-a-day logs suits the chatting paradigm perfectly. 

So ZenJournal was born. The resulting journal is just a stream of logs that you can write, read and filter right there as you open the app: no dedicated search or add view, just one simple stream. 

It‚Äôs an extremely simple app, but I hope it will help you as it has helped me in creating a balanced diet of private and public sharing. I‚Äôve used ZenJournal way more than any other social media apps I‚Äôve used. Also as a result, I‚Äôve been more active on Twitter as I‚Äôve ever been before this app. Why? I think it might be: we long for the connections that we create with people that we share our ideas with. But we often ignore the awareness and connections that we can create by being reflective. Social media are often open and permanent and, as a result, only reflect the highly curated and filtered part of our lives. On the other dimensions of fleeting and private digital space, we might as easily find peace as we find happiness on social media. 

I created the majority of the app over two weeks few months back using React Native. I spent the rest of the time procrastinating and doing way too many trivial tasks that I thought will marginally help the launch. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs finally launched here. AMA about the app and the process and let me know what‚Äôs your go-to system for journaling and what do you like/dislike about it?

I'd like to introduce you all to my first product, The Hyper.link. It's a list & newsletter that gets published every other week and includes 50 links in a wide range of 10 categories/topics. The categories are self centered and are focused on providing benefits for the reader e.g. spend some time, discover new stuff, gain general knowledge, improve yourself, spend your money etc.

That also explains why the categories are based on verbs.
Watch: movies, series, documentaries & books
Listen: music & podcasts
Play: games for PC, console & mobile 
Type: computers, phones, smartwatches & everything with an OS
Install: software, OS & mobile apps
Like: viral video's, stories & other content
Learn: general knowledge
Improve: health, fitness & life hacks
Spend: gadgets & crowdfunding
Follow: useful websites, influencers & channels for the above 9 categories

There are 3 simple rules for the list:
1. Hand picked: no bot curation or low quality content.
2. Instantly accessible: you must be able to use it instantly, so no trailers of movies/games that need to be released and no paywalls.
3. Quite different: no content that is mentioned too often on the web already.

I'd love to hear your feedback on the concept, the amount of links, the frequency of publishing (biweekly) and everything else that stands out! Thanks in advance.
@tcodinat Thanks Toni, glad to hear you like the concept! You can also just bookmark the homepage, since it will be always in sync with the newsletter.";4;-2;True;True;False;web development

And we have it in our roadmap to create templates where you can put a music bed under ANY section of your show in future. We'll allow you to take a 2 minute (or any length) section right in the middle of the show, and fade up music underneath it, play for the duration, and then fade out.

Does that sound like what you're looking for?

Really interested to hear what exactly you'd like this feature to do.
@bitrewards Thanks Alexander! Yep, totally lucky to have found the designer we did - Ryan's done a great job with the UX and the UI. Always happy to get feedback to make it even better though :D
@felicianotech Haha, thanks for the honest review Ricardo. You're right, Audacity is a great tool, and it's totally free. My aim with Alitu is that it saves a lot of time by bypassing Audacity and it's ilk altogether, by automating decisions around normalisation, conversions, including music and crossfades, exporting settings, etc. Totally, you can do that for free in Audacity, but I believe that a lot of people will pay a bit extra to not have to do it at all, and edit in a much nicer environment :-D

Cause psychological help is expensive, there is a long waiting list, and often no chemistry with the psychologist.

At the same time, you got so many skillful psychology students who have a psychology masters but can't find work. 

Talk Buddies are students or young professionals with different backgrounds that have a BSc or master degree in psychology or are finishing their masters. No life coaches or volunteers, but real and skillful conversation partners.

The concept is that a user can chat with different Talk Buddies until he/she finds the one that he/she has the most chemistry with. For an affordable price.

You get 30 brand new challenges with real world UI elements to implement and commented solutions for all of them.

My original motivation behind Frontloops was to help my friend land his first frontend job and he did that when filled his portfolio with frontloops code snippets. Now it's time for him to level up and become better at javascript and I'm already sure he's getting a promotion soon. 
It surely takes a lot of efforts to do that, however I really want more people to be able to repeat his success, so waiting for you at Frontloops!

Super excited to launch this today ?! 

95% of all recruiters and hiring managers use LinkedIn to find candidates. Additionally, millions use their LinkedIn profiles to attract clients and prospects to their businesses. LinkedIn is more important than ever in building your personal brand and career.

However, most people don‚Äôt take advantage of LinkedIn. Most profiles on LinkedIn are vague and aren‚Äôt optimized for what they‚Äôre looking for. This makes your profile harder to find and results in you missing out on opportunities.
 
I built this tool to change that. Upload your (or anyone‚Äôs) public LinkedIn profile in PDF using LinkedIn‚Äôs ‚ÄòSave to PDF‚Äô feature. The analyser will:
‚úÖ Score your LinkedIn profile against 50+ rules and criteria in seconds
‚úÖ Give you specific, actionable feedback on how to improve your profile‚Äôs visibility and discoverability
‚úÖ Grade each section of your profile, including your headline, summary and work experiences
‚úÖ Help you achieve your career goals by generating more leads, opportunities and recruiter requests

Plus, it‚Äôs 100% free ? You‚Äôll also get a unique link that you can use to access your review at anytime.

Try it for your own LinkedIn profile, or anyone else in your industry! You can ‚ÄòSave to PDF‚Äô any profile on LinkedIn and upload it to the tool. For example, here are the results for Reid Hoffman‚Äôs profile!

Well after a few months of hard work, it's time to introduce Blurt‚Ä¶

There's plenty of tools that allow you to write. 

There aren't tools that help you write. 

That's where Blurt comes in.

I built Blurt because I couldn't find a writing tool that had all the features I wanted in one place. I found myself switching between different tools for ideation, getting feedback, editing and publishing. I want to put all the things needed in one place.

<b>Please let me know your brutally honest thoughts if you're a writer who tries out Blurt.</b> I'm working to build a truly useful writing tool and space for you! ?

‚úÖ <b>Smart Edit</b>

<img src=""https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/381M170a2B0l3A1n1j0j/Screen%20Recording%202018-06-09%20at%2007.41%20PM.gif"">

When you blurt out what's on your mind, it's easy to get too wordy. Smart Edit aims to identify bad grammar, wordiness, and hard to read sentences so your work is easier to read. You can also highlight a word and Blurt will suggest a synonym. Blurt will eventually provide summarizations and other improvements to help you write your best.

? <b>Blur</b>
<img src=""https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/232m371w0c2J1M1R360u/Screen%20Recording%202018-06-09%20at%2007.36%20PM.gif"">

By blurring what you write as you type, Blurt can help prevent your inner critic from stopping you from getting your thoughts down by self-editing too soon. I brought this feature over from my former side project, BlindWrite, as an experiment. Has been fun to learn how it's of value to others.

‚è≤ <b>Writing Sessions</b>

<img src=""https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/261d3J2k3y1F2t0r2Y1f/Screen%20Recording%202018-06-09%20at%2007.34%20PM.gif"">

Writing sessions enable you to write for a set duration or word count. The aim of sessions is to help you get into a flow. I've found that sometimes you just need to blurt your ideas out before you consider editing them. You can use this in combination with the blur feature to really prevent your inner critic from getting your ideas out. 


? <b>Distraction Free</b>

<img src=""https://blurt.app/static/media/distraction-free.45c688b2.gif"">

The aim of Blurt's UI is to be minimal and out of the way. Text should be easy to read. Compositions should be distractionless. There should be a sense of freedom in Blurt to allow you to focus your thoughts while writing. This will take some continued iteration to get right, but will be a big priority going forward.

? <b>Outline</b>

<img src=""https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1C0h2n0L2t1i3g1T433W/Screen%20Recording%202018-06-09%20at%2007.38%20PM.gif"">

The outline view allows you to structure your writing. I find  creating a bulletized outline of my thoughts before writing helps me get started. It's also a good place to put notes, research, or links on a paragraph you're working on or haven't finished yet.

? <b>Writing Stats</b>

<img src=""https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0V1m0G3d1C463z1A4543/Screen%20Recording%202018-06-09%20at%2007.45%20PM.gif"">

Clicking on the word count in the bottom right will reveal how long it will take to read your work. Did you know the average human reads at about 250 words per minute? Now you do. :)

Blurt keeps track of how many words you write every day. You can set a daily writing goal to help you develop a daily writing habit. ""If you know you have to write something every single day, even a paragraph, you will improve your writing.""

? <b>Publishing</b>

<img src=""https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1m0d3s1T0c1J1A3k443B/Screen%20Recording%202018-07-05%20at%2004.25%20PM.gif"">

When you're ready to share your work, you can share its link with others. If you wish, you can make it public so it's accessible from your <a href=""https://blurt.app/@coreygwin"">Blurt profile like mine</a>.

? <b>Emojis</b>

@aramiggs Hey Aram! Thanks for the feedback.

I purposefully decided to require the paywall for two reasons:

1. It helps me qualify my users and validate the perceived value of the product. If there are users willing to provide payment details to check Blurt out with a paywall, I know I have a high quality lead. The action also provides significant validation of the product. Freemium can certainly be a great business model, but often requires significant overhead in  supporting non-paying customers.
2. I'm bootstrapping Blurt in my free time while working a full-time job. In an ideal world, I can turn Blurt it into a full-time business that pays my bills and affords me a standard of living. I can't do that without charging for my work so for now I'm trying a more aggressive strategy to get me closer to that goal.

I understand if you're not comfortable providing your payment details‚Äîhave received this feedback before. I can let you know if I decide to offer a trial without payment in the future if you're interested!
Great question @jiananli! This has certainly been on my mind.

I'm really focused on improving the writing process for writers. The focus has been more on the Blurt as a writing tool than as a writing space. There's definitely some things I need to bring up to par to meet expectations users have from other writing apps (highlighted comments, certain styling and formatting, etc.).

Medium is great for distribution but if you don't write something well, all that distribution doesn't really matter. So I think there's an opportunity to add value by focusing on helping writers get more efficient at capturing their ideas and making them digestible across different forms of social media. That's more where I'm headed.

That said, publishing is definitely an important part of writing. Most of us write with the intent of sharing. I'm waiting to understand what Blurt users end up using it for to determine what's next. I intend to provide export to other platforms like Medium and formats like markdown. I also intend to add some community aspects for things like feedback and comments. 

There's also some opportunity for Blurt to be part of email newsletter publishing. Also, interesting to note that not all writing needs to necessarily be shared. You can use Blurt for things like journaling, to help you organize your thoughts. 

For now, Blurt users can share their Blurts wherever they'd like with a link that's generated or from their profile. :)
@rrhoover Ryan! Thanks. Ya, it's been quite the journey bootstrapping Blurt!

The dream would be to be able work full-time crafting a product like Blurt for others. 

For now it remains a side-project until I can get the revenue to a place that lets me leave my full-time job. I'm hopeful after launching here today I can harness the traffic and comprehend some of the conversations and experiences Blurt users are having to decide what comes next. I need to work on the business model a bit if I'm gonna scale up, but still have a lot to learn now that I've opened the floodgates.

As for plans? I want to continue to focus on helping professional and aspiring writers hone their skills. Better analysis of writing (e.g. what times of day might you write best? How might you summarize or simplify things?), better helping writers develop a writing habit with reminders and weekly summaries of their productivity, and add collaboration tools.

I have a few other spaces to explore. I have some aims to grow communities and better publishing features. Trying to comprehend how much value Blurt can add outside of places like Medium or what the next Medium might be. While community is important for marketing, garnering attention or influence, it's also helpful for getting support, inspiration and feedback. The email publishing space also seems interesting for Blurt. I also think writers would appreciate some simple analytics, know where their writing is shared, how long it was read, how far a reader got in it, etc. 

Of course, also night mode needs to happen at some point. :)
@coreygwin @mijustin Wow! Thanks dude! ? Means a lot coming from you. I know, I felt a little crazy building another writing app, but had a sense maybe I was on to something different by focusing on the real, underlying problems of writing.

Definitely let me know how it goes. Really want to help understand and improve the writing process for writers like yourself and make it fit into your workflow.
@neilio I definitely have plans to have comments on edits for feedback! Not sure when just yet.

I'm definitely heeding the feedback on aggressive paywall! Will reconsider if found necessary.
@mark_bruckert Hey Mark! I definitely think Blurt is helpful for students! I actually got the idea for blur from a teacher who told me to turn my monitor off when writing so I wouldn't critique myself and prevent myself from getting my thoughts out. :)

I'm offering a $0.99/month plan for students. You can email me (<a href=""mailto:corey@blurt.app?Subject=I%27m%20a%20student%20interested%20in%20Blurt%21"">corey [at] blurt.app</a>) if you're interested in learning more!
@andrewaskins Andrew! Thanks for the novel! :) Seriously! Incredibly helpful insights! These are the things I hope to hear because I want to build a truly useful tool for writers.

Your gripe with Hemmingway et al. is exactly why I built Blurt myself. I want all the best of these tools in one place!

1. <b>Collaboration:</b> Collaboration (specifically, getting feedback) is something I'm working on. Currently, there's no way for a reader to provide any comments or Medium-like highlight/side-notes. There's also no real-time collaboration. You can however share you Blurt work's link without publishing it so it remains private. And someone can provide feedback externally prior to making it public on Blurt. This is a temporary crutch. The Blurt solution will likely involve something of a hybrid between Google Docs and Medium.
2. <b>Blog Platforms:</b> I'm totally with you. I want to smartly figure out how to make Blurt part of the solution, not another problem. Not another place you have to publish through. I think a smart export to specific social media platforms is a good start. Conceivably a browser extension could help. I don't have it figured it out just yet but would certainly work to come up with a better solution than copy paste.

Yes, really want to commit full-time to start solving these problems now! :) For now I'm working a full-time job and Blurt is on the side. I'm hopeful to start spending more time on it if things go well! I'll keep you posted as I sense you share many of the pains I've experienced and trying to eliminate. :)
@chuckmeister9 Hey Robert! Thanks for the kind words. Also, big thanks for your insight. 

I hadn't actually thought about this (that browser really is a distracting place) and you make a very good case for me to consider how quickly I can wrap Blurt up into a desktop app. ? Are you on a Mac, by chance? I'll prioritize it among the few hundred other things that have come up today ? and keep you posted!

Hey guys and gals, 

Apologies for dropping this parody app into your Product Hunt feed this morning. I figured some of you ""DESIGNERS"" might be interested and get a good laugh. ? It's built using WebRTC and IBM Watson's Visual Recognition service. I used Nuxt as my application framework. I have it set to ""MOBILE ONLY"" at the moment and you'll want to make sure you're in a non in-app browser. I've written about the issues of in-app browsers recently:

https://medium.com/@leemartin/in-app-browsers-i-forgive-thee-not-f87b25f9418e

After clearing up my freelance calendar, I started this week simply wanting to hack a bit and this is the product of that pursuit. It's pretty awesome what you can build in 9 hours with all these incredible services available. 

Let's see if we can get Virgil Abloh to use it!

132985;Task List;1.0;3;Yes;65;16/08/2018;16/08/2018 00:00:00;Thursday;No;No;No;"Task List is a personal Task manager and To-Do List App for iPhone and iPad that helps to be more productive.

Easily create and manage Your Tasks, To-Do Lists, Notes, Events in one App. Set reminders for Events and browse Tasks in Calendar. Use it offline and online and Sync between iPhone and iPad.

Task List App for iPhone and iPad has clear nested Groups > Projects > Task Hierarchy. I think that any task can be presented in this form, for example : [Hobby > Guitar > Learn New song] or [Business > Marketing > Business Task] or [Activity > Gym > Workout Exercise] or [Shopping > Electronics > iPhone]). This nested structure allows avoiding the mess in Task Management. 

Users can reorder tasks, groups and projects with a long tap. Tasks, Groups and Projects can have various priority (High, Low, No priority). Every task has various fields that are available without entering the task screen. Tasks can be moved to another project. The user can set phone number, note, website, money, location for every task and reach it from the tasks screen. 

Another important feature of this Task Management app is the ability to create Events. Every event belongs to a task and task can have multiple events. Events allow making Daily planning more effective and fast. You create a task first, and after that, on the Events screen you just press ""+"" and select the task. Users can set the planned time for each event, run it and track how much time spent on each event. Also if the user presses an ""eye"" on the events screen he can see how much time is spent on all events for each day. On the tasks screen, people can see the time spent on the task too (this time is a sum up of the events time for this task). Also, users can run multiple events simultaneously. You can store common info in a Task note, and a day-related info in a note that belongs to an event.

Users can share Tasks and Events (name and note info) with friends via social networks, email or SMS. Events can hold Notes and Tasks. 
The design is clear and simple, users can choose from a variety of colour themes. 

You don't need to log in to use Task List. If the user wants to sync via iCloud (between iPhone and iPad) he just needs to be logged in to iCloud on the device (no other actions needed). The developer has no access to user's data. Everything is stored on the device or in the user's private iCloud database. The app can be used while the user offline because the user's content stored on the device.

In the future updates plan to implement more awesome features.

Task List is easy in use and designed for iPhone and iPad users who want to be more productive daily.
@anna_0x Thanks, yes it is only for iPhone and iPad currently. It designed to work great on iOS devices. I respect Android users, but this app developed & designed from scratch by 1 person (iOS Developer) (myself) and I'm currently focused on the iOS ecosystem only to bring the best UI, UX experience there. No plans for the Android version in the nearest future, but a lot of plans for improvements and new features for iOS users.";3;-2;True;True;False;community

Hello Product Hunt!!!
Special thanks to @_jacksmith for hunting Bristly.

Bristly came up as a solution to the problem I faced being a pet parent.
I lost my childhood dog Micky to oral disease.
And then I found out it is the most common health issue among dogs.
4 out of 5 dogs show signs of it by the age of 3.

As a dog parent, I know that toothbrushing isn‚Äôt easy, and at times feels like an uphill battle with your pups.
We created Bristly to make this experience seamless and effective.
With Bristly all you need to do is to give it to your dogs for 5 min a day and let them brush by themselves.
We have tested Bristly‚Äôs beta version (Brite Bite) with 50K pet parents and their feedback helped us to come up with the upgraded version you see.
Any questions, let me know ?
Sorry, accidentally posted this twice :)
@khanum_nikoghosyan Thank you for your feedback! ?
@jhon_foster Hi Jhon, thanks for your question ? there are 3 sizes of Bristly: small, medium, and large - for virtually all dog breeds, the small size will be good for your puppy!
@david_sanchez3 Hi David, the meaty flavor of Bristly and its special design makes it attractive for dogs and usually most dogs love it from the first time.

@zhirayr_sardarian It's my pleasure!
@ninelleee Thanks a bunch Nina ?
@richard_dane Hi Richard, Thanks for a great question ? Bristly is a toothbrush, it's not a dog toy. That's why we recommend giving Bristly to your dogs for 5 minutes/day and then remove for use the next day.
@cleo_black My pleasure ?
@demetria_hudson Hi Demetria, Thanks for your question. BriteBite is the 1st version of Bristly, the feedback from the testings of BriteBite helped us to come up with a better version of the product.
@jenya_kazaryan Hi Zhenya, for heavy chewers we have a special Bristly heavy chewer version  which according to our testings lasted about 1+ months. ?
@louisa_warner Hi Louisa, we understand your concern. However, we are different from others, Bristly is vet approved and supported, as brushing is the gold standard for cleaning teeth, and Bristly accomplishes the physical brushing of both inner & outer surfaces of dogs teeth, on both the top and bottom rows.
@baboyan_mary Hi Mary, the rubbery material scrapes the plaque off and still bristles are quite soft not to hurt teeth and gums.
@baboyan_mary Sure ?
@gevorg_poghosyan We highly recommend the pet parents to supervise their dog while they brush using Bristly brushing stick.
@pernomina_alexandra Thank you so much for your support. Your babies will LOVE it!
@tatevik_bijoyan Hi Tatevik, Bristly is not a chew toy it's a brushing stick. So we highly recommend not to give Bristly to your dog for more than 5/min daily just to help your dog develop a  brushing habit.

These flash sales are fun, fast, and interactive, creating an entirely new way to shop!

How it works:

- Every stream we introduce a brand new gaming product from a top brand
- We have 5 LootBoxes and each box has an amazing, never seen before, Flash deal on the item of the day
- Viewers have 90 seconds to pick a box which they think has the BEST deal
- At the end of the 90 seconds, the host reveals the underlying deals in each of the boxes and viewers get the amazing flash price their box revealed

If viewers decide not to purchase the item, we give them Flashpoints (loyalty points) which they can redeem to switch boxes after the best deals have been revealed, in future episodes of the show.

Last week we sold Astro A10 headphones for only $19.99 and this week we are back with the Razer Cynosa Chroma Gaming Keyboard

Super excited to share our version 1 with you all. Would love feedback, especially since we are slowly enhancing and experimenting with our format!

Last year, we introduced Firewalla Red through Kickstarter and Indiegogo; this year, we are introducing Firewalla Blue. While the Red was optimized for affordability, the Blue will be optimized for power and speed. It is more of a Pro version than a replacement. Blue has faster processor and more memory to handle network traffic and attacks at near Gigabit speed. Blue will be based on the same software as Red. The same software that‚Äôs been protecting families across 57 countries around the world. Both boxes will be using the same App, there is no change. There will be changes in the cloud to provide more complex security intelligence for these newer devices.

When you visit a page, your browser tells our server to visit that same page, analyze its contents, and find the url of the privacy policy of the website you‚Äôre on.

handl then uses a natural language processing algorithm we have trained to identify and evaluate clauses within the privacy policies themselves.

Hey Daniel!
I've built FreshJobs on vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQLite with just a tiny bit of JQuery.

My journey in a nutshell looks like this:
A year ago I did 1 month of learning JS on a site called Code School. Then after that I started working with a company in a position unrelated to coding, so I did no more code for a year (and forgot most of the JS I had learnt).
Earlier this year in May I left that company and decided I wanted to get back into code, in June I decided to just go ahead and build things to learn. Since then it has just been Youtube videos and Stackoverflow, no courses. I've also never had any formal education related to computers or programming.

Before I started this project around 2 weeks ago I knew basically nothing about PHP or SQL databases, I had some good knowledge on JS from my previous project as it was heavily on JS backend. I'm totally learning everything as I go.

In a few days I will write a Medium article on building FreshJobs (just like I did after project #1 last month). For my third project I am considering to video log the journey (as I have a background in film making so would be good to merge the two!).

Anything else I can answer let me know! Message me here or Tweet @ me any time you please :)

Hey, thank you so much for your valuable feedback.
I have made the placeholder text bigger on the search fields, set the cursor to change and put a hover effect on the subscribe button, and then I have made the 'Post a Job' stand out more with a clearer hover effect also.

I'll look into pagination. I've not done it before so will take some time if I implement this.
A plan I have is to allow users to log in and favourite jobs they are interested in which should alleviate the issue of finding jobs again on the infinite scroll. My initial choice for infinite scroll was that it's good to keep users browsing on the site.

Thanks again for your feedback, it's much appreciated.";3;-1;True;False;False;creativity

Really appreciate your comments as well!

I'll add a comment with a bit of background and what are our near term pipeline looks like in a bit!
Hey Everyone,

Thank you for having us! We weren't planning to hit Product Hunt this early (ideally wanted a bit more traction!), but we're super happy to be here! ?

By way of background, we built and ran an e-commerce marketplace platform targeting the MENA region for almost seven years before our business was acquired back in May 2017. We took a few months off to recuperate and have spent the last year or so building Esanjo, which is essentially our parent vehicle for the next set of things that we want to build.

At some point in this journey, my younger brother and our COO, Aamir decided to kick off a fitness related startup, which unfortunately didn't really go as planned, but did result in the idea that was to become Lunatap. Without boring you with much more detail, he wanted a simple way to allow a coach or fitness instructor to be able to easily accept a payment on the go using their iPhone or Android device, whilst ideally using his existing Stripe relationship. 

A number of simple solutions to this problem exist on both the App and Play Stores, but we found them to be expensive (in most cases adding 1% or more on top of Stripe's standard fee structure) and not iterating in a significant manner post launch. Enter Lunatap.

We've designed and built Luantap to be a beautiful, easy way to take your Stripe account on the road. We like to think that we're at the beginnings of creating the equivalent of a tiny POS machine that's on your phone rather than being an ugly bit of extra hardware that you need to charge and lug about.

Today, Lunatap does multi-currency, accepts input via type or scan, and is competitively priced at 0.1% on top of Stripe's fees.

In our next version (v1.0.2!), which should roll out in the next ten days or so, we're aiming to add support for Spanish, French and German. It's the first time that we've built a product that isn't in English (but we've got a fair amount of experience executing in Arabic, heh), and is in a set of languages where we have no native speakers on the team (yet!). It's been an interesting challenge.

We've recently had a bunch of feedback about adding support to accept card input via NFC. Unfortunately this isn't a straight forward solve as far as I'm aware (and even less so on iOS), but it's something that we're actively working to bring to a near future release. We're also debating adding support for other payment providers, but we're big fans of Stripe, so this remains a hotly debated topic internally ;)

We would really appreciate your feedback (positive, critical or otherwise!). I'm also more than happy to answer any questions that you may have. Alternatively, you can reach us at https://lunatap.com/#support or via help@lunatap.com. Thank you again for having us! ?

A quick intro to why I built Notifiee:

When I make side-projects I usually want to quickly add in notifications to myself or co-workers when things happen in my app. Usually, this is really easy to do with email, since you probably have it configured early on in your project.

But what if you want to send notifications to yourself or co-workers through Telegram, Messenger, Slack, SMS, etc? Each requires a bit of configuration, even email can take some time to setup initially.

Notifiee essentially reduces this setup process in your own app to a couple of lines of code, i.e. set the API key for your project, then one line of code to send a notification to a 'notifiee' you've created within notifiee.com. The Notifiee interface let's you simply add 'notifiees' to send notifications to and set up their 'channels'. Notifiee 'channels' are common platforms for receiving notifications such as Telegram, Messenger, Slack, SMS, etc.

Would love to hear what you guys think about the idea in general and the process of using the service if you go that far. ?

? Problem:

I wanted to learn about the blockchain, so I thought to my self ""That couldn't be too hard!""
So I googled how a blockchain works and I had a really hard time wrapping my head around the fundamentals.

Articles were all hype and speculation, books were lengthy and boring, and the lack of interactive examples was pretty annoying. I'm not sure if you've read the ? Bitcoin white paper but after the second page things start to get pretty difficult.

Unless you've been living under a rock, you would've heard the words Bitcoin or Blockchain, perhaps you're heavily invested in cryptocurrencies or blockchain apps (mentally and financially). But, funnily enough, a free online resource for learning the fundamental technology behind them that the average person can pick up and understand, STILL doesn't exist.

?Ô∏è Solution:

A free online book with no jargon, math equations, or a cryptography and mathematics degree prerequisite. Something the average person understands without glossing over the details.

The fundamental concepts explained in simple terms and interactive examples for those who like ""learning by doing"".

Please note:

I've only starting writing this book about 10 days ago but I thought I'd go ahead and launch it. I'm not an expert on the blockchain, I just hope my writing style is simple enough and my coding skills are decent enough for engaging interactive examples. I'll be fixing things and adding to it as a I go so I can stay up-to-date with such rapidly changing technology!

My simplest answer is that the Classic Editor plugin will only work for the short term. It has been stated numerous times that this plugin is for transition and late adopters who aren't yet ready to switch to Gutenberg.

My other big concern is that this is just the first major change in a long line of future updates.

Hey Product Hunters! 

This is the 3rd major iteration (the first was 0) of the Ghost open source publishing platform. There‚Äôs a blog post linked above which talks about everything new and shiny included in this release, but I thought I‚Äôd share a bit more of the product story here for people who are interested in how the sausage gets made (can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs no sausage emoji tbh)

? The Backstory
Ghost launched in 2013 on Kickstarter as a new take on the traditional blogging platform. The difference: Deeply focused on publishing (rather than generic website-building), blazing fast modern codebase, fully open source permissive MIT license, with a sustainable business model, structured as an independent non-profit organisation. To date, there‚Äôs still not a single other platform which offers all those things in one place!

? Now
We've done about 200 releases, several million downloads, seen 500,000 sites running on Ghost (Including Apple, Tinder, DuckDuckGo, Mozilla, OpenAI and many more) ‚Äî and the software has matured a long way since the early the days. v2.0 is quite a departure, in many ways, from some of the initial principles which we started out with. 

The way we make product decisions has definitely evolved ??

I mentioned in our 5 year anniversary post - https://blog.ghost.org/5/ - that one of the biggest lessons we‚Äôve learned over time is that open/decentralised products fundamentally compete on power and flexibility, rather than outright simplicity. So while Ghost started out as an attempt to be as simple as possible, 2018 for us has been all about opening things up with more power.

We‚Äôre moving away from ‚Äúmarkdown-only‚Äù and ‚Äúa single stream of posts -only‚Äù as the way to write and read posts in Ghost - in two major ways:

‚úçÔ∏è We‚Äôve shipped a rich, extensible editor which you could loosely think of as ‚ÄúMedium meets Slack-Integrations, built on an open document storage format‚Äù ‚Äî the likes of which exists nowhere else in open source.

? And we‚Äôre enabling full site-structure control, meaning entirely new architectures, formats and collections of content are possible. Use whatever custom homepages, subdirectories, or route structures you want.

All of this represents a very conscious move to stay true Ghost‚Äôs core focus of publishing but make it more suitable to professional users who need more than just simple blogging :) 

? Will be hanging around here all day if anyone has any questions
@marcperel Hey Mr Marc! Great Qs

I think cards will evolve quite a bit, but the plan is for them to still feel like cards (ala Slack) and less for them to define layout (the pagebuilder approach). We'll need to see how people use and respond to it, but we're pretty keen on keeping the experience as focused as possible. A lack of focus in editors, in particular, typically just leads to a minefield of distractions. 

Content types - not yet, it's very simple right now, but we're thinking about this. There's definitely a lot of interesting publishing use-cases for more custom data. 

Themes are becoming more tightly coupled to site structure, now, and I think we'll actually continue to move slowly away from the idea of interchangeable themes over time. The more power and flexibility exists within the platform, the harder it is for a generic set of themes to all respond equally to core without including a tremendous amount of bloat.

Working on that last one, in particular, I think is going to be really interesting :)
@ronald Hehe, thanks Ronald! Let us know how you get on :)
@levelsio Excellent question! We've been working towards the next evolution here for a while now. While the first few years of Ghost was all about improving publishing, I think the next few are going to be pretty heavily focused on new business models for publishers. Finding new ways make revenue from publications is at a fairly critical juncture as the ad industry slowly disappears down the proverbial drain.  

I'm a big believer in the subscription model used by Stratechery, TheInformation and De Correspondent - and I'm interested if we could facilitate that type of business model using Ghost in future.

Beyond that, in terms of what's coming next? Lots of API stuff, probably ?
@sara_palmer Hey Sara! Things have definitely changed quite a bit since we launched 5 years ago, and the whole publishing landscape is fairly different now to how it was then.

I think quite a few things have shifted in an interesting way. For a while, Medium was the hot thing which everyone was migrating to, then it seemed to become clear they were never going to find a business model and everyone is largely shifting away again. Meanwhile WordPress is still on track to be a great website builder, and is still moving further and further away from publishing. And most of the other platforms which were around when we started, simply no longer exist.

I think in 2018 Ghost is still the only open platform with a rock solid publishing experience. There are closed platforms with amazing editors, and open platforms with amazing tech - but we've got the best of both worlds. The goldilocks choice, if you will! ? <= (this is ramen but lets pretend it's porridge if you don't tell anyone I won't either)

The other advantage is quite centric to places with traffic or commute issues. Since Apple reminders uses ‚Äòon arrival‚Äô or ‚Äòwhen I leave‚Äô options only, it tends to notify during commute simply because it assumes you have arrived. We are based in Bombay, we know this better than most of the world ?. Anon on the other hand calculates basis your dwell time (customisable) and thus notifies only when it‚Äôs certain you are in that location. 

In future updates though we plan to release themes and a lot of other features which would set anon apart.

By sharing stories about solutions, we can show that doing better against a problem is possible and there's at least one potentially replicable model on how to do it. So if someone reads about a town in Vermont who was able to reduce their rate of opioid abuse by X%, that someone from somewhere can have more productive conversations with friends, family, and local lawmakers about how they can solve that same problem in their community.";2;-4;True;True;False;creativity

Some of our core illustrators include Len Smith, creator of Toon Town in Who Framed Rodger Rabbit and Richard Walsh, experienced illustrator and also has worked on educational games (Math Blaster/Reading Blaster).

Of course when more stories are published, more illustrators will join. :D

We also support skeletal animations, so in the future, we will be pushing towards making sets of characters that can have different costumes and can be animated. So you can create a story where you can customize your character!

We have been helping brands with content marketing, since the past few years. More often than not, companies approached us for something we were not equipped to provide as a standalone service:

Content. Yep, content sans marketing. It was like, ‚ÄúLook guys! We don‚Äôt want any help on content marketing. Can you just provide us with content?‚Äù

That was not the only thing that set things in motion for the new Springzo. I have always been wanting to write articles for our blog, at least every week - I had stories to tell, experiences / opinions I wanted to share, convey what I have been learning while running a content marketing micro-agency, and so much more. But with all the daily struggles of running an agency, writing content for it always took a backseat. 

I longed for something like this - where I simply share an outline with a content writer; just my thoughts in the form of bullet points or a note recorded during my commute. And she fleshes it out, creating a finished piece of content that I can publish on the Springzo blog, on my Linkedin account or maybe, even as a Twitter thread!

That‚Äôs how Springzo happened‚Ä¶ 

Springzo is a simple unlimited content service. You tell us what content you need (share the topic / outline / bullet points / audio recording / reference article / just anything that helps us understand WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR) and we send the finished piece to you in 5-6 days.

Our promise: top-notch content written by expert writers, with the least amount of back-n-forth to get the content you are looking for, and maximum value for money.

We also back our service with a 7-day money back guarantee! 

How did we build it?

Going the clich√©d way, we started with dogfooding our own service. We have dozens of minutely vetted writers in our network. We decided to send a weekly newsletter (essentially, a near-to-longform article shared over email) to all the brands we work with. I shared the outline in bullet points with our content writers and it worked really well!

We also wanted to stay lean when we test out the service while launching it to the public. So, rather than setting up complex request management systems or CRMs, we went ahead with the no-code way:

- Email to accept requests and all things client communication.
- Trello to keep brands updated on the status quo of their content.
- Google Docs for content, edits and iterations.
- Tidio for onboarding new customers.

That‚Äôs the long and short of our journey! I‚Äôd love your feedback on Springzo. Happy to answers any questions you have.
Also, if you're looking for content samples, we have them here: https://www.springzo.com/category/content-samples/
@bitrewards Hi Alex. We assure to deliver a minimum of 4000-5000 words. Having said that, there have been instances where we have been able to write around 7000 words/month too. So, it depends on the type of content you order during the month. For instance, take these two articles:
1. Who Are We Fooling? Is One Day Really Enough To Save The Environment?
2. It Took Me 1 Hour to Explain Everything about Blockchain To My Grandma! Here's How I Did It!

The second one involves a lot more research and the writer will need more time, and re-writes to satiate the intent behind the topic.
@footer Hey Amin, that's an interesting perspective.

Also, I'm glad you brought this up. When I was writing the homepage's copy, I had the same question - when we say 4-5 days for 1000 words, is it really ""unlimited""?

To have a more thoughtful answer, I must have looked at dozens of other services in the productised / unlimited tasks space. Here's what I learned:
- a whole new category has been created for the ""unlimited tasks"" offerings, meaning you do not have to educate (definitely, not a lot) the prospects on the limitations of a service like these. They are able to gauge the value vs. the spends. Potential customers actually understand what you mean when saying ""unlimited"".
- almost every service has ""unlimited orders"" vs. ""unlimited tasks done"" categorically mentioned.

I think the real value of a service like ours is, every time you need content, you do not have to go through the pain of finding a freelancer, apprise them of the brand's voice & tonality, ask for timelines, follow-up on the status of the content, etc. Even if you are comfortable with one freelancer, you always have to deal with the uncertainty of whether their hands are full when you have some content to be written. 

With Springzo, you just tell us what's the content you want - we take care of every other thing - research, engaging content, grammar, timely delivery, edits, content in brand's voice, etc.
@footer @mattholsinger I agree. Thanks for taking out time to help us with your feedback. 

We will experiment with something like,
""Hire An Expert Writer For $___"" . Or something like, ""Get On-demand Content Written By Expert Writers For $___""
@footer @mattholsinger I get it. Will surely try out that copy as well.

P.S. It's for comments like this, we need +100 button :) Have gotten some really helpful feedback on copy as well as the service offering over here as well as live chat.
@mdorsett Wish you great success with the experiment. Do shoot over your content samples / more details to hello@springzo.com. You can also follow this link and submit an application form: https://zo.springzo.com/become-a-writer
@joeadamg Sorry to hear the sample articles didn't meet your desired content quality. We will surely look at improving the same. 

In the meantime, do have a look at other content pieces we have published:

@joeadamg @taylor_banks Hey Taylor. Thanks for your feedback. We're continually striving to improve the quality of our content. For instance, we are experimenting with having a native English copy editor to vet all the articles before we send them to clients.

Having said that, I'm pretty sure the quality of our content in its current form is surely way above par.

And most importantly we'll be looking to add about 3 more new and unique products to the app before the holiday season kicks off, to help you maximise sales during the busiest time of the year! 

We're currently looking at an Etsy integration with the app to make it easier for sellers to publish their products there. And we've also been getting a lot of requests for WooCommerce integration, so we're looking into the possibility to implement that as well.

Fellow Product Hunters!

Last month, I launched Graam here and was super inspired by all the support I received from all of you. I‚Äôm excited to launch a new major feature (that a lot of you requested)  - ability to create multiple lessons & accept payments through the platform.

As infants, we didn‚Äôt have to attend a lecture or read a textbook to learn to speak, eat or walk. We mostly acquired these skills through imitation and actually jumping in and doing the task. And I think that it‚Äôs one of the most powerful ways to learn something new. Lessons incorporate this as the main guiding principle.

A lesson is a session (usually in-person) or over Skype, where you teach someone how to make something or accomplish a goal in few hours. For example I can teach somebody how to build a simple app in 2 hours by building an app with them and showing them how I do it. Teaching someone by getting them to imitate me and jump in and do the work, hands on.

Like I mentioned last time, I just graduated from college and I'm working on this project full time. I'm going to be working on this as long as I can possibly can and you can follow me on twitter/medium for monthly updates!

Cameron from the SiteFocus team here. The CIF Analytics Cloud (for Zendesk) is an app that turns support tickets into customer insights. We make it easy for folks to get the insights they need from data that's traditionally been tough to crunch: text!

How it Works in a nutshell: 
We use a symbolic AI* to discover what‚Äôs relevant, map relationships by context, and provide traceable analyses (supporting excerpts + direct links to relevant tickets)

Nice to know:
 - 1-click integration - no data science or coding
 - Built for speed - results in seconds that anyone can read - like automatic CliffsNotes for tickets
 - Slice & dice - we've added support for Zendesk filters (tags, date, status) in addition to custom keyword search (Boolean or regex)
 - Time Series with text - automatically create custom profiles & monitor change over time
 - Business-friendly plans - pay-as-you-go, no contracts or obligations
 - Start at $25.00/month for 1,000 tickets, upgrade anytime ($50/month for 10,000 tickets)
 - 14-day trial for up to 1,000 tickets (to get your feet wet!)

Thanks for taking the time to read. Love to hear your thoughts!

*Side note: Symbolic AI isn't hard to get, but difficult to implement. The Eureka! moment here is achieving autonomous learning - a system that can learn on-the-fly with any text across any domain w/o human input. In other words, we can cut out the time-consuming & cost-heavy data tagging & training typical of solutions that center on natural language processing and understanding (NLP, NLU).";4;-3;True;True;False;web development

With my hearing aids at full blast I can get some idea as to what is being discussed in a meeting or on a phone, but it takes a great deal of effort. Thus, I avoid such situations as much as possible. However, I believe I am a strong contributor with a great deal of creativity and a strong tendency towards innovative solutions. So how can I share my ideas with others without having to resort to meetings, conference calls, etc?

Email comes to mind but only when it comes to a simple conveyance of information. The more complex the information, the more difficult it becomes to effectively communicate it via email. Powerpoint was my darling for the longest time, but there are limits to that as well. I can‚Äôt break down information very effectively in Powerpoint and for the most part information is presented in a linear fashion, which is not how I think. I loved the idea of Mindmapping with its ability to break down elements, so I could better understand them, but again to me it did not seem the most effective way to share that information with others. So in my one stoplight town in Ohio, I started learning how to put together an organic solution that would meet my needs. 

I developed Solveboard to organize and share information with others, without having to resort to trying to explain it on the phone or in a meeting. Effective for even the most complex topics, Solveboard allows me to break down information into a series of boards which then can be navigated by viewers. Using Solveboard, I can avoid meetings because I can create a meeting board allowing users to engage in conversation threads about specific topics. I can avoid the agony of having to answer questions after a presentation by providing them a board with all the supporting information included for their review. I can keep my team on the same page by creating a team board, and updating topics of interest as needed. I can create project boards which keep project members on task and up to date, cutting down on the email traffic floating around. 

Then I thought, this might be useful to others as well. While Solveboard is still in its starting stages, I think perhaps this Deaf guy can bring something new to the conversation?";4;-4;True;True;False;web development

My name is Ariel ??

I developed Cuanto last year as a side project after being inspired to learn code and draw inspirations from other great builders on here. The end result became the first Dominican currency converter. After over a year of continuous iterations, I am pleased and confident enough to say that (with growing effort) Cuanto will lead the digitalization of the Dominican Republic. I am currently in the genesis of creating a P2P payment system that can be used in paradise. 

I‚Äôm sure I will get a few questions around the validity of this, so i‚Äôll just address some of those here:

Are you crazy?

Yes, but I believe in making really cool shit for the internet while trying to foster innovation to my country ??

What does Cuanto offer that Google can‚Äôt?

Cuanto was fully developed and launched solely for the niche Dominican market and the millions of tourists that love visiting. Using Google would simply require internet connection that is not always available.

Does Cuanto use an API?

Not yet. All Dominican Peso (RD$) rates displayed on the footer are updated monthly via in-app updates.

What can digitalization of the Dominican Republic bring?

With the recent emergence of new business models, we are seeing neighboring African countries leapfrogging older technologies to create digitally enabled solutions for local populations. The convergence of social, political and economic factors‚Äîincluding a high demand for basic unmet public services, the spread of smartphones and broadband access‚Äîthe global growth of the digital economy can make the Dominican Republic a center for development innovation in the Caribbean.

What is the future of the Dominican Peso?

Inflation for sure, but other than that it's tough to tell. Consider this though: Mobile money can mitigate the risks associated with traveling with large sums of cash that are often catalysts for crime and corruption.

Is Cuanto being funded?

No, but we would love to get in contact with leaders, creatives, educators, philanthropists and investors to continue growing as a company in a utopian effort to make paradise a hub for innovation in the Caribbean.

Thanks for the message. I made the app and I'm a credentialed teacher. The tips do get a little harder as the year goes on and many are designed to help students be familiar with common core standards that they will encounter in K. Ideally it would be perfect if a child could start the app one year before kindergarten, but it certainly doesn't need to be. Some tips are things most parents would know, so in a sense they are more just of a reminder. But it's been my experience in 19 years of teaching that most parents don't know what to do. It's totally understandable - they haven't been in K themselves in 30 years, they didn't go to graduate school for education, they don't have time to research, are working 2 jobs, etc. So many tips might be things someone might not think of. For example, all parents know to read nightly to their child, but many are surprised to learn that they should read with their finger. Every year I get several students who don't know that we read from left to right because their parents never modeled it. It's not something I can just mention in a lesson, it needs to be modeled over and over until it becomes second nature.;2;-1;True;False;False;creativity

?The struggle:
My desktop is my favorite place to put all the files when I work on any project, especially when there are images and design stuff involved. BUT it gets messy so fast and easy, it's worse when you work on multiple projects.

?Desktopz...
I built this app to solve this problem. Why go down the rabbit hole looking for that project's files when you can bring them to you with ONE click! Keep your desktop clean and organized, only shows what relevant to what you are working on right now, nothing else!

?How does it work?
Black magic! AKA symbolic links. Your files are safe!
Put your projects anywhere you want on your drive and add it to Desktopz. Once you click the yellow run button the magic begins and your project content will show up on your desktop!
@mkarnicki 
I think there is something wrong with your DNS settings (cache)
Did you try on a different device?
@mkarnicki @w can you try https://desktopz.herokuapp.com/
@mkarnicki 
do you use google DNS
@mkarnicki I have a friend here who is using google DNS and have the same issue. once he turned it off the domain works
@ivanyc that options is not available atm. But if Desktopz didn't work for any reason you will get a refund. thanks

Hello everybody ?

Here Jos√© Francisco Calvo maker of Squadpanel.

I have been working in big companies in recent years and sometimes to know everyone in the organization is a really difficult task. And if you are working in a remote position that‚Äôs even more difficult! ?

So I thought that a tool where you can easily see all the people from an organization could be super cool. Even cooler if you receive notifications when a new person enters the organization (or when a person is leaving too) and with the possibility or organize your members into teams.

At the moment we are in Beta and that means:

    * We are learning from our users and creating new features!. ?
    * We are not charging any price to anyone. We prefer to learn and when the application is really useful to our users we will think into how to monetize it.
    * Any feedback is more than welcome so please send us an email to questions@squadpanel.com or write here a comment.


Thanks to all the people that help us to make this possible. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@theodorasarahabigail of course we are open to add new fields. For things like hobbies we have the ""bio/description"" field where you can write this kind of information. Do you think it's enough for hobbies and specialties?.

About the searching. Right now you can search internally for information about your  organization members. We are thinking into a new ""public"" mode that can be optionally enabled by organizations and in that case we will think into some public search (i.e. search for the name ""Sarah"" into the organization ""MyCompany"").

With Flinder, you can discover fun things to do based on your location, weather conditions and current time. For instance, if you open the app at night it'll give you suggestions to go to a pub, karaoke bar, nightclub etc. If you open it in the afternoon and the weather's kinda sucky it'll recommend activities like visiting a museum, go to the movies, all kind of indoor activities. It'll also show you nearby places related to the activities.

I‚Äôm a 4th year maths student at St Andrews University and have recently created an online statistics community ? called Black Swans (www.blackswans.io).

The site allows users to post about anything related to statistics and then other users can comment on these posts. E.g., perhaps you had successfully predicted the result of every World Cup ‚öΩ match and wanted to share the story of how you did it, or maybe you wanted to find people interested in developing a quant trading strategy ? with you.

We also run competitions ? on the site, e.g., best solution to our puzzle ""Who's Doing the Dishes?"" (www.blackswans.io/post/9/) wins ¬£100.

When I realized that Instagram now lets third party developers post stickers to Instagram stories through deep linking, I immediately thought there is a lot of potential.
As an avid Instagram user, I've always looked for new ways to use the platform and wanted more tools to create cool stories.
With AnySticker, you can create a sticker and post it within a few seconds. Just type some text, select an icon and a color scheme, and you're ready to go.

Please let me know how you like it and I'll be here in the comments if you have questions.
@jure_sic Hi Jure!

It's a bit complicated, the Instagram API itself does not allow multiple stickers to be added, but you can kinda do it:

1. Shoot a story in Instagram and press the 'Save' button
2. Create a sticker in AnySticker and launch it in Instagram
3. Position the sticker and press the 'Save' button again
4. Create another sticker in AnySticker, select the saved story and launch it in Instagram again.

So you have to jump through a few hoops unfortunately, but I think enthusiastic Instagram Stories posters will not be stopped! ?
@ladu91 Thank you for pointing these out! I will address these in an update. I'd appreciate if you could tell me the Android version and which model it is, unfortunately we are seeing different devices behave very inconsistently unfortunately.

We've been in ecommerce(https://www.zahomy.com), specifically fashion accessories and shoes, since Jan 2015.

Many customers always ask for many photos via WhatsApp or Messenger before they choose what exactly they want. While at it they always ask many different questions about the details of the products. Sending the same photos repeatedly on WhatsApp or other messaging platforms becomes a manic process, especially when you have to keep typing the details all the time.

One question kept bothering me as I searched for content on Twitch and other streaming platforms.

Why do I like streamers who are so different from each other?

The answer went beyond their personalities. It had something to do with my own purpose for watching them. 

Sometimes you go to streamers for entertainment but when you‚Äôre trying to learn a new game or adapt to the latest patch you seek educational videos. All gamers know the thrill of watching the top plays of skilled streamers, as well as the challenge of finding alternatives to your favorites who are not that frequent online. Last but not least, sometimes all you need is a person on the other side of the screen who‚Äôs chatty and ready to answer your questions.

Stream Servant helps you do exactly that with our unique founding principle called Stream Style.

More cool stuff you can find on Stream Servant:

? Multiplatform - Search for content on all the major streaming platforms. Follow everything in one place. Let new viewers find you.
? Extensive filters - Find exactly what you're looking for. Filter by game, language, tournaments, gender, online status and more.
? Search - Use the ultimate stream search engine. Watch all your favorite streamers and find new ones. Get the most relevant results.
? Profiles - Connect accounts from different streaming platforms. Create schedules and events. Add videos and images. Make yourself stand out.

I am the maker of Mars or Earth. 

Mars or Earth is a comment-crowdsourcing app which aim to gather comments on the Mars photos to help the scientists advance their research on space exploration. You can click on the photos and comment on the photo you find interesting. All comments will be posted on the Twitter account @teammarsorearth for all to view and share.

I believe that humans terraforming Mars is an important task. Currently there is still little interest in the space industry. 

WHY THIS APP
There are 2 main reasons,
1. As aforementioned, there are so many photos sent back by the Curiosity Rover everyday. There is a very very slim chance where the staff at NASA may miss out certain details in the photos which MAY make a difference to our mission to colonise the Red Planet. By creating a platform for people to browse through the photos and post comments on the photos conveniently, we effectively increase our chances to spot any anomalies on Mars. 

2. Generate interest in space exploration. Interplanetary colonisation is a far-fetched notion to many but it is an ambition we should all aspire towards. It may be a mission which will last through 2 or more generations of people yet we should treat it seriously. Resources on Earth will run out eventually and it is high-time to look for sustenance for our future generations. The space community is still relatively small and more work can be done to get more people interested in the space industry.
@alexwinkyface yeah I understand what you mean. I hope to generate more interests in future Mars missions as well through the app. I had a epiphany one day to make this app and I just went ahead to give this idea a try! 

thanks for your honest opinion! :)
@loomiassistant thanks for sharing! this program is very relevant to what I'm doing here at Mars or Earth!
@booligoosh thanks for your interest! currently tight on resources, but I'll try my best to make an android version soon!

@bitrewards Hello, and thank you for your question, Plaster differs from other Sketch kits with the following key features:
1. All components, bars, buttons, input, etc. follow a simple symbol structure that has same consistent properties through all components without exception, this makes the learning curve easier for newcomers in Sketch.
2. Plaster has both atoms (components) and compositions (screens) built from those components that, this allows to quickly create both high and low fidelity prototypes/wireframes.
3. Plaster follow and use the 8pt grid for both Android and iOS components.
4. Has a really vast amount of components that are available in 3 different themes, with the ability to make your own theme of all components.
5. Stays up to date with latest Sketch updates, new components and screens are added each in every new version.
Cheers!
@levibostian I'm here to help you, Material is a word to describe common design components like an 8pt grid, elevation, icons etc, you can use them to design for both Android and iOS, and yeah I can say it will work because it just rules, and it's up to you to apply them to different devices, like here-https://material.io/develop/ios/. Still, you can change colors, border-radius, fonts, text sizes, elevation all in one place and have a completely different theme that will fit you need and won't look like a classic material/ios style.";3;-2;True;True;False;creativity

@ngme93 Hello, There are 2 points to the term smart! The mobile application that comes as an option to the straw attaches the meaning to smart because of the app providing education, cessation, awareness and social sharing, therefore coining the term smart. The second part to smart is that the straw itself is a very reasonable alternative to plastic straws and single use plastics. By using the elo straw as a smart choice, overcomes the waste of plastic straws it saves from landfills etc. Hope that helps!
@guiiipontes Thanks for the information!
@guiiipontes @jakewesorick  Thanks again for this information and insight!
@ngme93 @meloffbird Hi, The app is an option within the rewards! It is available to use as a dedicated reminder while providing insights to what is happening within the plastic movement. It is a 21 day challenge to change as part of marketing elo and driving more awareness towards the anti single use plastic's movent. Yes there are reminder apps. This was built to specifically provide a cessation challenge and straw use! Cheers,
@magnuson Hey, The idea when making the video with plastic cups was to show that the straw and the overall straw bans occurring around the world, started with the straw and that we have a ways to go to removing or replacing single plastic products from the fast serve marketplace. ELO is my first product launch from the company Elo Labs, which will look at other disruptive products that would affront plastic items like cups. But we are just starting and yes plastic cups will be in market but look how far the straw ban has come! Up next cups and lids! Cheers,
@askdaylen Hi! The elo straw and app will be just one of those metal straws on Amazon after the KS campaign! There are metal straws all over the net! elo was created to be branded to raise awareness about alternatives. The media has been putting a lot of focus on abstinence (no straws) paper straws and the plastic scourge created by quick serve restaurants and their role in the mess that is plastic single use straws. It is my belief that we can change habits and refuse and reuse straws that can be in your home, work and bag! I most definitely did not think I would be carrying a 3 by 5 inch smartphone in my pocket! A starw is just like a pen in a bag!

My name is Maksim and I'm happy to present my first launched project ?

DailyQ is an iOS app that helps you track your daily tasks and develop a habit of completing them every day. It has a clean and user-friendly interface. DailyQ doesn't require you to spend a lot of time for it, it requires only 2 minutes: 1 minute in the morning to read your tasks and 1 minute in the evening to mark your tasks as 'completed' and 'failed' - that's all. To make sure you will not forget to do this, DailyQ will remind you in the morning and in the evening to open it and spend a minute for it.

I would love to get your feedback and answer your questions :)

I'm super excited to announce the new CoderYouth!

When I started CoderYouth a few months ago, I had no idea it would become such a great community. Lots of people (including me) have found friends who share the same interests as them; they've found ""their place in the world"".

Now, it's time to evolve. 

CoderYouth started as a forum, but starting today, it'll be a lot more than that. Here are some of the things I'm launching today:

? <a href=""https://chat.coderyouth.club"" target=""_blank"">CoderYouth Chat</a>: We're moving from the forum to an existing Discord server called <code>code()</code> where most of the community already hangs out.

? <a href=""https://stories.coderyouth.club"" target=""_blank"">CoderYouth Stories</a>: If you're a teenager launching a product here, I guarantee you'll recieve at least one comment about your age. Why is it normal to play guitar or piano, but not to code? Let's make teenager coding the norm and not the exception by sharing teenager stories with the world!

?Ô∏è <a href=""https://mob.coderyouth.club"" target=""_blank"">CoderYouth Mob</a>: Nowadays, it's very hard to rise above the noise. It's specially hard for teenagers who don't have the resources startups have. The CoderYouth Mob is an experiment where the community promotes projects by other members. Can we get traction?

? <a href=""https://meet.coderyouth.club"" target=""_blank"">CoderYouth Meet</a>: Human interaction is a great way to avoid burnout, be accountable and have fun. And what better than monthly calls with your friends at CoderYouth? Share your work, give feedback to others and have fun in general!

While CoderYouth is a teenager-only community, you can help us by sharing it with the world ?

@highaced Hello Jordan, I don't know Canny that good to to tell you exactly. But we sure are similar. There are many new tools that operate in this area. FeedBear came from a personal need and I thought ‚Äì why not build this for anybody to use? 

It's still early to tell how, but I'm sure our customers' specific needs will separate us further down the road.
@shreyaa_ratra yes, the option b is interesting, thank you :)
@vladdesign Thank you! I didn't know Conflux. Competition is mostly complicated and bloated with features. I built FeedBear as a simple and lightweight alternative to Uservoice. Honestly, I didn't do much research of other competition (mistake #1). 

Regarding future updates, I plan to focus on extracting useful information from the feedback and metadata around it. People who give feeback are the most valuable customers who shape our products.

@abadesi How it works is that you just tap the coffee cup button, it spins, and it just lets you the user know whether you are buying this round, or they‚Äôre buying. There are a couple funny sounds based on the response and wheel like action, and that‚Äôs it! Problem solved ?‚òïÔ∏è

@aparkhills Thanks Andy!  Definitely noted, but those really are the only three screens in the app (outside of an ""info"" one via popup in the corner).

Chat Circles maker here.

I‚Äôm super excited to launch our beta on Product Hunt today! Chat Circles was a crazy idea that I dreamed up and decided to build. Here are a couple of things that make it unique:

‚Ä¢ It ditches the typical social data feed for a new spatial, synchronous interface. Just like you would go up to and talk to someone at a party you can go up to and chat with someone in a circle.
‚Ä¢ Messages self-destruct. When a message disappears from your screen, seconds later it is purged from our servers as well.
‚Ä¢ When you join a circle it expands a little. The more people inside, the bigger it will get!
‚Ä¢ You can create an account or choose to chat anonymously.
‚Ä¢ Encourages more authentic interactions rather than gamifying with likes and followers.
‚Ä¢ Notifications will always be opt-out by default.
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs free forever and will never serve a single ad.

I‚Äôll be in the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Chat‚Äù circle from now-2am and 8am-12pm PST. Come through and say ?hi! 
(my username is ‚Äúwill‚Äù)

P.S. I‚Äôve made a special ‚Äúsecret‚Äù circle that I‚Äôm only posting the link to <a href=""https://chatcircles.com/c/secret"">here</a> ?

I have been developing Devo as an open-source project on GitHub, which you can reach from <a href=""https://github.com/karakanb/devo"">here</a>. All the bugs, features or contributions are very welcome, hope you enjoy it!
@techsushant Thanks a lot for the feedback. Definitely on the backlog, and planning to add platform selection and placement, which would allow the users to update which platforms they see and where they see. Thanks! :)
@tostartafire Definitely a valid concern. Maybe I may add an option to randomly hide the page on new tabs to prevent distraction as well. Thanks a lot for the feedback! :)
@cdypmpr Thanks a lot! Actually the reason I have built it this way is me being lazy to visit the pages individually, this is why it did not made sense to make it a webpage. I wanted to see these platforms without visiting them directly, which is made possible by a new-tab extension. Anyway, if you would prefer the website version, I have a regularly updated version here: https://burakkarakan.com/devo/

I'm a 26 years-old web-entrepreneur and much more : an excellent procrastinator ! ? And it was a real problem to achieve my goals...

To stop struggling and not reaching my objectives, I needed something to help me keeping myself on track.? Being a visual person, and a bit perfectionist, I found my solution : creating a tool to make my daily progression visual (and beautiful !) to motivate myself.

And here are born the printable Productivity Trackers :

? Make your progression visible to motivate yourself and your whole team
? Set yourself a purpose and then achieve it with easy daily tasks
? Take easily news habits by being used by the rythm of the daily objectives
? More engaging and memorable than the usual ""good resolutions"" and funny as an Advent Calendar

And eventually, get rid of procrastination !?

If you like to see things getting done, you will want to color the entire animal, and that means doing all the tasks you gave yourself. 

I've been using the Productivity Trackers for 4 months. And since, it is way easier to reach my goals !? And no more fake excuses to not get the things done !?

‚ùì‚ùì How does it work ‚ùì‚ùì

You have a sheet to print for each month, and an animal drawn with boxes to count the days. Once you‚Äôve established a goal to reach and daily goals, you color the box corresponding to the day that just passed if you did the task you assigned yourself with for that day. 

It‚Äôs more motivating than the usual resolutions, you know, the ones no one remembers after a few months and it‚Äôs still not done a year after....

The way it works is very simple:

1.) After signup we learn from you about what kinds of content you wish to put out. We also perform our own research on your existing content & social feeds to learn about what has worked for you in the past.

2.) We find only the best and most targeted content and share the content automatically for you on your Twitter feed.

3.) You can then additionally set up your tweets to also populated on a Facebook page, LinkedIn, etc.

Some of the other benefits of MoSquatch:

* No echo chamber (sharing the same content as everyone else). Every MoSquatch account is developed 100% uniquely by hand.

* Our tweets sent for you look like any other tweet ‚Äî nobody will know they were tweeted for you.

* MoSquatch can do targeted retweeting for you. This is a not only great for sharing cool content, but for getting noticed by important people or businesses.

* We put out nothing but high-quality tweets. This means no garbage content from people who paid to get content promoted. We are not getting paid to promote content from bloggers or special interests like other curation services. We only care about putting out the best content for you.

* We put out new content only. Our advanced searching algorithm only goes back the past 24 hours. You do not have to worry about sharing content from several months ago.

*No surprises. Other services can put out untargeted or even inappropriate tweets. MoSquatch would never do this to you.
We have some special offers for Product Hunt users...

25% coupon for any plan = use the coupon code ""producthunt"" at signup.

We also have another special offer that is almost 50% off, but is for our annual plan only.

That will get you annual service for only $499. That is about what you would pay for one month of use for a tool like Curata in comparison.

That special annual code = ""hunter""

I'd like to share with you a passion project of mine. Humemo is a simple reminder app that also allows you to send reminders to other people. After being reminded to do things and forgetting to remember them, I thought, what if someone can just send a reminder to my phone and have it automatically remind me about it? That‚Äôs when Humemo was born. 

Features:
  - Attachments (image & location)
  - Snooze reminder 
  - Repeat reminder
  - Reminder HUD (Heads Up Display)
      - Displays what's up next as a persistent notification in the notification shade
  - Cloud back up
  - Send reminders
      - Requires a Humemo account. Send reminder to people from your contact list or using an email address. If recipient doesn't have a Humemo account, an email will be sent to them instead.

I hope others will find this app useful in their day to day as it has been for me. The app is free with basic features and rich features require an in-app purchase. However, PH users will get a free promo code to unlock rich features. Just send me a direct message.

Humemo is still under active development so any feedback would be appreciated!

There are many extensions that improve productivity and cure tab hoarding. Well, I think it's about time we get a decent one that ruins those things.

I did this just for fun and to practice typing with 10 fingers. I wanted to make something fast, simple and stupid.

The extension doesn't allow you to close tabs. If you try to close one, it reopens twice. You also can't close subsequent windows. At first, this seemed moronic to me, which is why I decided to do it.

But there might be some value in it, though.  Things can get out of control quite fast, unless you avoid opening so much crap in the first place. So in a way, this extension encourages you to open as little stuff as possible and reuse tabs. This means you'll supposedly have less stuff open, less distractions. You might even have enough RAM to run Slack properly.

For the time I was developing this (and therefore using it), I noticed some of my habits slightly changed. I never had a tab problem though.

Anyway, I guess this might be useful after all. Doubtful, but...

Increasing the scroll speed is definitely helpful for scanning a long page quickly! I think the extension solves a slightly different problem though. 
I got the idea when I was reading long articles. I always like to keep the paragraph I'm reading neatly aligned to the top of the window so I can easily find my position again if I get interrupted. At some point I got really irritated because the step size of the scroll wheel did not allow me to do that quickly and accurately. I would always under- or overshoot a little bit and trigger my OCD. At the same time, unlike on a touch device, where you have very direct control of the scrolling through your finger, using the mouse wheel does not let you anticipate the exact target destination very well. Your eyes have to closely track the movement of the content across the screen and stop at the right moment, which becomes a tiny but annoying distraction between each paragraph. So my thought was, since I already know where I want to scroll to, why not just point there directly?
I like to compare this way of scrolling to turning a page in a book: it only takes an instant and your eyes don't have to track anything but can just jump straight to the top of the page because you already know that's where you're going to continue reading.
I really like how snapping to the next paragraph now feels a little bit like ticking an item off your to-do list :)
@lebaux That's really useful feedback, thanks a lot! I haven't actually tried it in Vivaldi but I will definitely have a look now and try to fix the issues. Configurable long click duration is a great idea too, I will probably be adding that.
What exactly do you mean by customization of distance? Currently, the point you click on will be aligned to the top of the screen. So clicking further down will scroll a longer distance. This might not be communicated clearly though, which would be an issue. Or did you mean something else?
@magnuson Haha that's exactly how I felt when I decided to make it! I'm very glad to hear I'm not the only one and that it's useful to you too. 
I agree that it would be even simpler without the keystroke. I am a bit worried though that it could become too intrusive and trigger unwanted scrolling when the user just meant to click on something. What do you think? No harm in experimenting with it as a configurable option though.

@retendo Github considers the trending projects to be the ones most starred in the given period, shows you only 25, there is no option to check the trending projects in the past, they don't remember your choice and they don't have any browser extensions. GitHunt does all of that. 

Githunt selects and sorts the projects in the selected period with most stars among the projects created in the selected period; and so it allows bringing up the projects that might not be able to hit the trending page but were most famous among the ones created in that period. You can check the trending projects from the past years, months, weeks or days. Choices are saved and reloaded when you visit again and also there is a browser extension which allows you to replace your new tab with the trending projects returned by GitHunt.";2;-1;True;False;False;community

We're so glad you're enjoying them!

@dave_poly 

Hey Dave, you get 3 pairs for $35 with the PRODUCTHUNT promo code at checkout.
@dave_poly 

HI Dave, currently in the market, the highest Silver content we'd seen was 5% of Silver ions. (they're just bits of silver sprinkled on and get washed out easily).

With our socks, we wanted to try something new so we upped the Silver content to 20% and had it threaded in alongside the cotton. 

This approach leads to a stronger built sock that never loses it's antibacterial properties. 

This is the reason we're not getting any complaints, the socks are built to be better than others that are available and the methods we use justify the prices. 

To give you an idea of how much they cost, we're not really making a profit on the socks as they're priced now. 

And personally, we air-dry our socks outside so we're not familiar with the sock monster haha (we hope it doesn't like silver)";4;-2;True;True;False;creativity

Like many people, I got deep into cryptocurrencies near the beginning of 2017. One thing that I learned very quickly was that the market was emotional: it responded quickly to news, both positive and negative. The correlation between price and sentiment seemed obvious, so I decided to explore the data.

I discovered that this was rather hard to do. The predictive effect of sentiment analysis is tenuous, but correlations between price and sentiment do occur. While I was initially planning to make this a paid product, I've decided instead to open it up for anyone to view.

Over time, perhaps, when the markets become less volatile, the predictive effect of the data may begin to emerge. Until then, you can use this as another data point in your investment strategy. Best of luck!";4;-2;True;True;False;community

Am exploring if we can support web-UI testing also. If possible, that would be pretty disruptive.
@naveenkumar JMeter is only for perf-testing, but Karate is designed for functional-testing. What this means is when you want to perform complex assertions on the response JSON or XML - you have to do a lot more work in JMeter (by default you typically only check for a 200 OK).

With Karate you get the best of both worlds: you start off by writing functional tests and later you can re-use them as performance tests via Gatling. There are lot more points but the other important one is JMeter is UI-driven which means it is hard for teams to collaborate via SCM or Git, and CI automation (though possible) is that much more of a challenge.

Karate also has an API-mocking capability built-in.
@naveenkumar yes I don't want to get into a back-and-forth here :) Please do take a look and let me know your feedback. Perhaps I should blog or write an article on Karate compared with JMeter. JSON assertions and data-driven testing are built-in to Karate, no plugins required.
@naveenkumar oh and by the way, when you say ""please check the test plan option in JMeter"" you should probably know that I'm the person who created this: https://code.google.com/archive/p/perfbench/
@naveenkumar sorry that screenshot doesn't tell me how to perform complex JSON assertions and ignore dynamically changing fields in the response. If you have Gatling in your ""perftractor"" Karate is the same, else no.
@naveenkumar ok, here's a challenge for you. implement the JSON / JSON-path assertion in the last line of this file in JMeter and show me :) https://github.com/intuit/karate/blob/master/karate-demo/src/test/java/demo/graphql/graphql.feature";3;-3;True;True;False;community

So online psych self-tests/questionnaires are not new, but I feel like the user interface/experience for a lot of those can be quite overwhelming. 

I thought maybe I can make them with simpler, less-overwhelming UI. A past similar project got around 13,000+ test takers (so far) to finish (a 92% completion rate).

I have coded up about 30 questionnaires, but decided to shrink the number down to 14 (for now) to cover common cases like depression, anxiety, stress, social phobia, OCD, ADHD, etc.

Note that these are NOT DIAGNOSIS tools, but rather screening tools to see if you should get help. Only trained professionals can make the diagnosis.

The questionnaires were made by psychologists/psychiatrists and have been validated/peer-reviewed (references available) - I merely made a different user interface to make them interactive and added automatic calculation. Hopefully this helps people.";2;-4;True;True;False;web development

Hmmm? there's a ""Add a cafe"" button right in the middle of the page when you first arrive, and at the bottom there's a blank entry (where a city/cafe should be) that says ""Add a place""... I'm guessing those were not obvious to you...where should I have placed the button instead?
@duiker101 thanks for the tip! Yeah I considered adding libraries too to the list, as in Singapore, the public libraries are like co-working spaces.

@michaelgangnath appreciate the feedback. Yes, it's very much still a MVP, a work in progress. Hoping the nomads here can help flesh it out as it's a community resource more than a for-profit project. ?

Hi @joepvanleijsen and @jcserracampos, saw that you gave a thumbs down review for Coffice City. Care to share why? Love to hear your opinion. ?
Thanks @quin_caylor. I'm not settled on one for Sept yet, still in process of thinking it through a few shortlisted ones. Appreciate the offer but I'm unlikely to have bandwidth for other projects at the moment!?
@air_on_web oh nice, do you want to add some of those cafes in SF into the list? ? Yes collecting data is the hard part, and I can't do it alone neither can I scrape because this requires human curation in a way. Not all cafes are created equal for remote work unfortunately...

Tell me more about the block of text...is it too long? Too much explanation? I feel like I need to explain what it's about because it's for quite a niche purpose, yet folks are saying drop it, so trying to figure out what's the sweet spot...

I kinda like the emoji though. It was fun using it and increasingly I find more and more sites adopting it as a visual language. It was directly inspired from nomadlist so I don't mind coming across as a knock-off, if that helps to give credit to the original inspiration! ? Like they say, ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."" Haha

I'll keep building it as suggestions come in, at least for the next few months. Will have to course-correct as I go...not sure how this will pan out. Tbh I didn't even expect it to get featured on PH!

This is Kuba from Devskiller. We‚Äôre launching DataFairy today, a generator of realistic fake data for software testing and demos.

Until now, generating profiles for testing and demos was a pain. When we were building Devskiller we needed good data to test and then demo the system but none of the data from available data generators made sense.

We built our own solution as a fun open source library called JFairy. We wanted non-technical people to be able to use this data as well so we created DataFairy as an easy, user-friendly way that you can generate good test and demo data.

The data generated by DataFairy:
-Pass verifiers (credit card numbers)
-Connect logically with the other data on the profile (ID numbers match sex, age, and location)
-Includes realistic sounding names (no more Waddington Pickwicks in your demos)
-Can be downloaded in bulk
-Generated in 7 languages (English, Spanish, Polish, French, German, Swedish, Chinese)

We‚Äôd love to hear what Product Hunters think about it.

I made this new thing called Catsnatcher. Here's the problem I had and the solution I thought of:

? Problem

Catsnatcher was created because I was looking to get into Amazon Private Label selling earlier this year. I found other product research tools useful for when I had an idea I wanted to research, but I‚Äôm not terribly original, so pretty much everything I thought to search had already been crowded out. Also other tools focused on single listing-level metrics rather than showing me the stats for an entire niche. 

So what do I want? As all Amazon‚Äôs data is public (including indicative sales levels via BSR), I figured there should be a way just to absorb everything, categorise it into niches and use this to find the best possible options rather than starting with a guess.

? Solution

I soon realised that there are so many subcategories aligning to different products - the perfect way of structuring listing data to product ideas. I decided to take all Amazon‚Äôs data for each of these 40,000+ categories and analyse it to show how profitable, competitive, scalable each of them are.

It covers all metrics from profitability, sales levels, reviews, listing quality all the way to how many variants and accessories niches have. The beta is stored in a Google Sheet to allow for simple sorting, filtering and searching of metrics. There is a tab with all the subcategories and one with the top item listings within each for when you want to dive deeper into a niche.

Let me know what you think!

? Thanks to my Amazon Private Label friends who egged me on, big shout out to Ria for posting and everyone else who helped in any way!
@tttiiibbbooo Thanks Tibo :) 
I understand your point about checking the data quality initially; perhaps I could provide a limited sandbox of data to show what I've collected and how it works before people commit?
$60 is for two months access and in the post-beta version I intend to increase that $30/month as it will be easier and much faster to use and have additional features. Still not sure if I'll bill monthly or quarterly, though...";3;-2;True;True;False;community

Since, collagen has changed my life (my skin, my hair and my health have significantly improved), and I wanted to bring it to everyone around me; and fast forward a few months, I founded Crushed Tonic. I‚Äôm also writing a collagen-based cookbook called The Collagen Glow, underwritten by W.W.

We built this review crawling infrastructure for Reviewshake, which was no easy feat. I really wish there was an API like this when I started out, so decided to open this up as an API to the world.

Why would you want an API for reviews? There are many use cases, Reviewshake being one. Here are some others:

- Amazon product analyzer - use product reviews to generate reports about Amazon products.
- Marketplace platform - aggregate and show off reviews for sellers on your platform.
- SEO analysis tool - reviews impact SEO, and this is your tool to build data around it.
- Financial analysis - use reviews for various sectors to analyze public companies and build models around their stock price.
- Machine learning data - use real reviews to train your machine learning models.
- Aggregator services - include real reviews on your restaurant, lawyer or _insert niche here_ website.
- Real estate analysis - use reviews to analyze real estate trends by neighbourhood, city, state and country.

I'm excited to see what you build with this! Let me know if I can help in any way ?
@rui_barbosa_junior Glad to hear that, our whole goal is to abstract away any complexity for you :)
@cosbgn Thanks for your support!
@chrismessina I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm not a lawyer, so this is not legal advice. This is a tricky subject but based on the reading I've done, there are no legal ramifications of using review data. Review data basically equates to facts/information/ideas, which are not protectible under U.S. copyright law [0].

In addition, in the 2017 case LinkedIn v. HiQ, a judge effectively made it legal to scrape publicly available information [1].

With this said, it may be best to consult a lawyer depending on your use case :)

@orliesaurus thanks for your comment :) i thought long and hard about this architecture but i'm certainly open to ideas. the issue is that fetching reviews can take a while - eg. if you give us a URL with 20k reviews, so we figured it'd be best to set it up the way it is.

also didn't want to create a queue ID, thought it'd be easier to just use the URL as an identifier. that simplifies things for the user, and for us as multiple people can share the same URL. hopefully that makes sense? adding a completion webhook etc would make this more complicated as you'd need an endpoint to receive that webhook, no?
@orliesaurus ah thanks so much, so glad to hear you think that! we do a bit of that in reviewshake itself haha, we consume this api ourselves... but would love to see what you come up with :)";4;-2;True;True;False;community

What I call ‚ÄúInstagrammable‚Äù are places that look amazing whatever the photographer or the camera ‚Äì they‚Äôre so cool it‚Äôs almost impossible to take a bad photo!

All of the places I listed are public and free to access, and <a href=""https://instalist.app/submitted?ref=producthunt"">I would love it if you submitted some more</a>, especially if that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre from or where you currently live. Right now, the list is a bit random as it‚Äôs all places either my friends or I have been to. If you would like to list a commercial location, for example link to an awesome hotel, restaurant, shop, Instagram account, or magazine that caters to travel or photography lovers, you can do so by <a href=""https://instalist.app/advertise?ref=producthunt"">purchasing a featured card</a>. (boring but transparent monetization strategy)

To celebrate the launch, you can also try and <a href=""https://instalist.app/win?ref=producthunt"">win a free feature</a> by submitting your Instagram handle. That‚Äôs just for you Product Hunt kitties! ??

I‚Äôm thinking of adding more interactive features such as a map, the ability to save places to a ""want-to-visit"" list, etc.

Awesome question. We come from a research background so the following is ultimately what informs the product. Decades of Industrial Psychology literature and studies have proven the most predictive factors of on-the-job-success to be general cognitive ability and personality (predominantly conscientiousness) with a set of others that contribute as well. Meta analyses prove these factors to be many multiples more predictive than traditional data such as education, experience (experience is more predictive in earlier stages of one's career) and specifically unstructured interviews. Outcomes vary based on the study but education and experience have been found to have 1% and 1.1% predictive ability as compared to the combination of cognitive ability and personality at 50% and increasingly more with the complexity of the role. The introduction of machine learning is extremely interesting in the context of psychometrics with proven predictive data. We also have the opportunity to embed real-time feedback and train models based on company specific data. I hope this is a good start (there's quite a lot of depth as I'm sure you can appreciate).

For example, this Page Builder comes with 30+ addons, 60+ ready blocks and many layout packs which you may not find in other page builders for free.
@talesgonsalves well, first of all this is a premium quality free page builder. 
The main advantage is that you have 60+ ready blocks that will help you to create amazing layouts in minutes and all are free.

There are 30+ amazing addons/elements which are also absolutely free.

And, if you are a developer, you can create addons/elemets, blocks and layout packs and sell/distribute without any limitation.

More importantly, this is a new page builder and we are working really hard to add new features day by day.

Consider Google Chrome while it was new, but it got improved time by time and became so powerful. I hope you got some ideas :)

We have not fixed the price yet but it won't be expensive for sure :)

In terms of moving from another page builder, I think it's not possible right now to migrate data from another page builders because page builders store and distribute data using different methods and use different technology but we will try to make this possible in future.

2. It's support custom posts but we will all other features in the future.
3. I have no idea about Brizy's plan.
4. It's page builder right now but we may introduce site builder features in different way. Let's see.
5. Well, to be honest we do thought about it and in future we may introduce such options.

Thanks again for your feedback.
@pointandstare I am requesting you to install on fresh WordPress where other page builders are not installed. May be the plugin is conflicting with other plugins.

@theshadyx Hey Dean, sorry to hear that. 

Here's the thing, the GA api Quota had exceeded but the issue has been resolved. Can you please try signing up again?

Also, can you please post a screenshot? i should be able to help you better that way.?
It's been a tremendous day. ?

I've just created a job board for mobile developers based in Europe. The idea of another tech job board may look ridiculous, but I found the process of browsing job offers for mobile developers really annoying.

As a guy who is living in Poland, I'm also not interested in remote job offers to demand US residency or availability in US time zones.

My name is Bernardo, I am part of the GoHeart team.  Allow me to share a quick story about Bob, our founder. Many years ago he fell in a valley while on a mountain bike adventure. While trying hard to get his friends to help using his phone, he realized that the valley didn‚Äôt have any communication signal. His only hope for help leaves him in a very complicated situation. He could not contact his friends or share his location and he didn‚Äôt have a choice but to gather all the strength he got and crawl to the nearest road where a group of drivers helped him.

And that's the reason why we are pre-launching this product today. Because getting hurt or lost is something that happens sometimes more times than we would like to. 

GoHeart Mesh Outdoor Networking Device can be your savior. It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to get help, track friends and talk to them without needing internet or telecommunication signal. It works without internet and is totally user-friendly. This device can be used as a SOS button by simply doing a long press. It can be used as a walkie-talkie and can also send voice and text messages. The device can share GPS location for the tracking of the fellow members too. This device has military applications and some amazing benefits as it works in caves and underground too. It can give up to 12 hours of use when switched to low power consumption.

Right now the production is being funded through Indiegogo to be able to further scale its production. Pledges are available from ¬£126 or approximately $169 for a pair of GoHeart devices with worldwide deliveries taking place very very soon this September.

Looking forward to hear your feedback.

All the Best,

Hey everyone!

I'm @ethangromet, the founder and creator of The Designer Bootcamp: the only course you‚Äôll ever need to learn App Design. The App Design Course focuses on the technical skills you'll need to be a great designer. It is an entry level course that provides a toolkit for mastering the most popular design programs. From designing interfaces to prototyping interactions, this course is extremely fun and rewarding. We'll design 5 different applications: Spotify, Uber, Tinder, Instagram, and an app of your own creation! There is no prior experience needed as this course is extremely hands-on.

Here's what you'll learn:

‚Ä¢ Design REAL mobile applications using the newest tools and plugins.

‚Ä¢ Master Sketch, the premier interface design program used by top technology companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, and many more.

‚Ä¢ Create your own application from scratch.

‚Ä¢ Design screens from real life apps pixel for pixel.

‚Ä¢ Think like a designer and get access to design resources.

‚Ä¢ Get familiar with the most popular design plugins.

‚Ä¢ Speed up your workflow by learning shortcuts and symbols.

‚Ä¢ Prototype your designs using Invision and Principle.

‚Ä¢ Learn how to animate designs with transitions, loaders, and modals.

‚Ä¢ Continue to learn and grow as a designer, long after the course ends.

‚Ä¢ Use Sketch Mirror to view your designs on your mobile device.

‚Ä¢ Design icons using vectors and shapes.

‚Ä¢ Work using UI design best practices.

‚Ä¢ Learn how to design a status bar, tab bar, and nav bar.


Who is this course for?

This course is for anyone who wants to learn about App Design, regardless of previous experience. In fact, the course is perfect for complete beginners with zero experience. If you think designing is complicated, I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs really not that hard. Unlike coding, this is extremely fun and visual. As a designer, you're able to communicate your ideas to friends, family, future employees, engineers, and even potential investors. You're able to get whatever is in your head, down onto the screen to turn all of your concepts into reality.


Would love all your feedback on the course!";4;-2;True;True;False;creativity

Thank you so much for taking the time to give such in depth feedback. It‚Äôs greatly appreciated.

As a start up company, we are at the very beginning of our journey so your feedback is very helpful and will be taken on board. I think you are definitely right in the fact that this type of product calls for a heavy marketing spend, and a different marketing approach. We are focusing on breaking the taboo around periods and revolutionising the way in which periods are experienced, and so speaking with girls in school and teaching them about alternative menstrual products is definitely something we will be implementing in the near future. 

Thanks again for your feedback it really is appreciated and very helpful information. 

Kindest, 
Paige Fashoni.
@astghik_azaryan between ¬£26 and ¬£28 depending on which style. They last over three years, so just think of all the money you‚Äôll be saving on pads, tampons, and stained undies!
@dayaldave haha yes love the name! Thanks Dayal :)
@realdeanward Hey Dean! 

Lots of women say that reusable menstrual products including cloth pads and period underwear like ours, reduce menstrual cramps. This is because the sustainable and natural materials do not contain the bleaches, toxins and chemicals that disposables do. The chemicals in disposable pads and tampons are used to whiten the materials and draw menstrual fluid away from the body at a fast rate and into the disposable pad/tampon, but in the process, have been known to irritate and dry out the vagina, causing increased pain/cramps. 

As for reducing the flow of periods, period underwear and reusable options like cloth pads tend to absorb much more than disposable pads absorb, and so it may seem like the flow is a lot less than when using disposables.

So glad you like the look of FLUX Undies, and hope you spread the word with your friends & family! 

Would love to answer any other Q's you might have :)

I had the idea to make this around a month ago when I was super busy and  <a href=""https://twitter.com/0xferruccio/status/1028930860677062656"">tweeted</a> it.

Last week, I stumbled upon a the mockup I made of it and decided to challenge myself to ‚õµÔ∏è ship it in a month. I thought it was going to take a long time because I didn't know any Swift and was using Clojure for the back end, which I never used before. 

Surprisingly in 7 days I ended up having a working product ready for launch! 

<b>Now I'm here to ? launch, but most importantly to get  ? feedback and ? ideas on how to improve this and what I should build next.</b>

Happy hunting,
Ferruccio :)
@ftxrc thanks :)
@anthilemoon thanks :)
@alexanderisora this is a hard question! My plan at the moment is to get as many people as possible to install klipped.in
Once I have a good user base I want to introduce paid accounts so people can claim ownership of their favorite klips, and add some premium features for them like file/image hosting or like embedded klips in websites for ""now"" pages and other interesting/useful things users will come up with. If you have any other ideas hit me up :)
@deadcoder0904 it took me a long time to find that lo-fi hip hop tune ?
@gautam__jain yes :) my goal was to make something simple that doesn't have too  many features, but is very polished
@ksaitor thanks raman, means a lot coming from you!
@stefano_rosso1 grazie Stefano! I hope to see more italian makers like us launching products
@owenfar1 Thanks a lot Owen. I knew there were other people like you having this same idea that would use this :)

Answering your questions:
1) User accounts are on my mental roadmap, but I'm thinking about only requiring accounts for premium features. At the moment every time a value on a klip is updated, the previous one is overwritten and deleted, for premium users it might be a good idea to have a history.
2) Klips aren't encrypted at the moment, they are public on the internet, for anyone to access them, so no need for encryption. Private clipboards of premium users would be encrypted though and maybe i could introduce ""password protected"" klips too.
3) Answered in 1)

Maker Notes is just a way for me to share how this challenge is going while trying to connect with other makers. You'll see these products grow in front of your own eyes, and I hope you'll enjoy the journey as much as I do.

I'll share everything in this newsletter, from this very PH launch to every dollar earned with my products. I also won't hesitate to share my failures ?

Maker Notes is actually one of my products that I wanted to launch, so I'm starting this challenge with this simple newsletter ?

The first issue will be sent today (Friday) or tomorrow. Stay tuned ‚úåÔ∏è

Also, thank you @andreyazimov and @rdev for making <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/preview-hunt"">PreviewHunt</a>, it helped me a lot as it is my first ever PH launch ?

You're right, it's really meta to make it one of the products, but it's part of a bigger picture. Basically, I want to show that even a newsletter can be a product of its own. It matters a lot to me, as someone who doesn't know how to code (yet!).

Clicks are expensive, Groupon eats your profit, Amazon takes a large slice too and flyers are ineffective.

We're hoping to give small businesses some ammo to fight back and survive in this tough environment.

@alekplay That is correct, the app does listen for every incoming message but the messages are never sent to a server to be checked if they contain the appropriate commands, it all happens locally on your device. The messages are never stored either. Having every messaged checked may sound worrying which is why a privacy policy in place making it illegal to collect any information about your messages, location or people in your contact list. Any more questions then feel free to message me, have a great day!
@astghik_azaryan For locating the device using a text, this is what happens: Location SMS receives a text message and checks if the text contains 'Where are you?'. If the text contains 'Where are you?' then the app will check if you have allowed the sender to request your location or the text or the text contains an authorisation code. If that is true then Location SMS will find your location using GPS and replies with a google maps Url with a pinpoint on your location. For the Geofences, every set period of time, the app will get your current location in the background and check if you have entered or exited one of your Geofences. When you enter or exit a Geofence, a text can be sent to contacts of your choice.
@anthilemoon  For locating the device using a text, this is what happens: Location SMS receives a text message and checks if the text contains 'Where are you?'. If the text contains 'Where are you?' then the app will check if you have allowed the sender to request your location or the text or the text contains an authorisation code. If that is true then Location SMS will find your location using GPS and replies with a google maps Url with a pinpoint on your location. However, if someone had stolen your phone and it was turned off, you could still send them a 'Where are you?' text and the second the thief turns it on, the app would receive the message and instantly reply with his/her location.
@pointandstare You can set an authorisation code that allows you to locate it from any device without setting up any account. Just remember to code and text 'Where are you?' + the code. If you don't want to use have to type the code each time with certain phones e.g. you have a second phone then you can select that contact to not require the code. However if you or a friend haven't got a phone handy, then Location SMS can't help locate your phone but most people have phones these days, just ask someone to text your phone for you to locate it. Have a nice day :)
@ayush_chandra Thank you :)
@babken_karapetyan Thank you! Try it out to see how well it works ?
@pointandstare Yes
@ben_s88 No mobile data is required for Location SMS to work, it just needs some service to send and receive texts.

I'm Diana, this is my second product on PH! 
I think that dapps (= decentralized gaming applications) are fun and their gaming assets (collectibles) might be a good investment for those in the know:) Those creatures often are animals (Kitties, Cuties, (poke)Mons,pigs) but there are also objects like crystals and planets. People who invest in cryptocurrencies can see their portfolios in thir wallets, or in the exchanges, but poor gamers have (well, had) to enter each game's site or settle for the number and the type of creatures in Metamask.

Bumped to be featured on Product Hunt today! We built Awario Leads to help entrepreneurs, marketers, and sales professionals unleash the power of social media to find new customers and early adopters for your business. 

Awario Leads' approach to prospecting is different from what you're probably used to. The setup is very simple: the tool will ask you for product descriptions (2- or 3-word phrases describing your product) and the names of your competitors. Awario will then search through Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Google+ and other social media of your choice for mentions of those keywords. Finally, the tool will filter the results using predictive insights to find posts where people are looking for recommendations on a product like yours, and those who are complaining about a competitor and looking for an alternative.

As a result, you get a personalized social media feed full of potential customers that self-updates in near real time, with an opportunity to engage with the posts right from Awario. 

Check Awario Leads out, feel free to ask me anything below, and please help us spread the love!

P.S.: If you need a hand with your Leads setup, use the little chat in the bottom right corner and let our Support team know what your business does. We'll be thrilled to help you with setting everything up.

@ntamboly thanks a ton Niloufer!
@kensavage thanks Ken! While we don't have a 'list' of sites we crawl (it's quite literally every site we can find online), there are some exceptions - in particular, sites restricted from crawling by robots.txt. So unless the site you're looking to search is restricted from crawlers, we should pick up mentions from it soon.

That said, we've just released something called the Whitelist - a list of pages to crawl as a priority for any given alert. Currently it only supports Facebook pages, but we'll be adding other data sources, including the web, as we go.

In the beginning I built an API generator to help my big brother - is from non-IT background - that he want to integrate some application services in his office. I started to think if anyone else out there has similar problem, don't have enough programming knowledge but want to quick start providing APIs for their cloud services or just want to learn non-backend development things.

Apisentris want to solve situation above with these MVP features:

- Generate RESTful API from any MySQL database (coming soon for other databases)
- SQL Queries
    * Ordering
    * Limit and Paging
    * Filtering
    * Association / Table Join
    * Create, Update & Delete
- API usage statistics
- Whitelist access by domain or IP addresse

It is my very first product and I'm bootstrapping it as a side-project for now but I'm encourage to ship everyday even though it is a small improvement or minor bug fixes.

If you have some thoughts to make this product better, please let me know :)
Thank you so much for your time.

1) Visible web - This is visible to crawlers (Google index)
2) Deep web - This is invisible to crawlers. (Google, Bing are can't index the web content, because the data is secured by search forms)

Deep web is 500 times bigger and has high quality content. Neither one can search, nor can see these data, until you issue a query.

More over, Deep web always has entities (Products, people, articles, open source projects, home, car, etc).

To search these data, You always has to use the website's search form along with search parameters.

This is where Alertfor helps, it turns your native search queries into alert (Sends email when new entities found) for your query).

Example query:
I want to search open source project in github, with the keywords ""parser"" and sort by a language ""python"", and sort by ""Recently updated""

If do run at Github, I got the following query URL.

https://github.com/search?l=Python&o=desc&q=parser&s=updated&type=Repositories

New results may come every day or hour. Just copy past this query into query field, with your email at Alertfor.com. The tool sends you new open source for your advanced query from Github website.

Hope that I have made it clear, Let me know if you have any queries !

Reworn.co makes it more easy to browse second hand clothing and also helps you provide the right items for you with various different filters while promoting buying second hand. We believe that second hand shopping is the right way to buy clothes in the future, because it being cheaper, environmently friendly and offers a much more diverse selection of clothing.

Reworn currently lists items like luxury jewelry and jewellery from big brands, designer clothing for low prices, and other clothing from brands like: Nike, Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger, Tommy Jeans, Polo Ralph Lauren, Puma, Supreme, Levi's and many more...

Why Shop Second Hand?

? Save Money
While today's fashion trends become more and more expensive, by shopping second hand you'll often find clothing for up to 90% off the retail price. On average, second hand clothing costs 50% less than it does from the stores.

‚ôªÔ∏è Save The Environment
The production of clothing has a big impact on the environment. Huge amounts of resources are needed to produce your fashion. For one pair of jeans, between 900 and 1,500 gallons of water is needed. Shopping second hand also prevens perfectly good clothing from ending up on the landfill.

? Support Small Businesses
Support smaller businesses and individials instead of big orginizations.

Any feedback on the beta or final version of the app is greatly appreciated and we take all recommendations into consideration.";3;-2;True;True;False;web development

<b>? Problem</b>
So I love to follow a good Twitter thread from the beginning until the end ?.
But your know how your  timeline is exhausted quickly, so you have no more threads to read.

<b>So where can you find the all newest threads?</b>

There are various options to read and write  threads or tweetstorms, but none to actually find the threads!

<b>? Solution</b>
I built a web app so you can add all the hottest threads you find, and share them with other thread addicts.

It works very much like <b>?Product Hunt, but for Twitter threads</b>. So I decided to call it <b>Thread Hunt </b>

?Let me know what you think below
@cameronswrld Thanks!
@imromains Yeah you're right I could change it because it's read only, all others are not used
@imromains Cool thanks :)
@rgoodwin I will think about it :) I designed it to scratch my own itch at first and I'm happy with how threads look on Twitter. That's why I didn't include a full unroll of the threads so far. But I might if it makes sense for a lot of users...
@frcbls Thanks :)
@kangurkarl For now you can filter by language and/or hashtag using the menu on the left. Is that good for you? What kind of categories would you like to see?
@ayush_chandra Thanks! I'm not sure what you mean? Because on other social media, most threads are multi user, the format is different
@chrismessina Not really. Thread reader displays Twitter threads with a different format, but doesn't help you discover new threads. Thread hunt is the opposite: Only discovery, them back to twitter to read all the content. Maybe I could make that clearer on the site?
@gorkemcetin Thanks for the feedback, yes I forgot to address empty language/ Hashtag ?
@chrismessina Yes, and the highlights change everyday :) What criteria are you looking for when searching for threads?
@chrismessina Now you can discover hot threads on purpose! You can make it a habit to check what's new daily, instead of relying on a chain of retweets for threads to land on your timeline (sometimes 3 days after they are posted). Of course, if your like another product's format you can use it along Thread Hunt :)";3;-2;True;True;False;web development

This is Maria, CEO & Co-founder of Crammut. I‚Äôm very excited to introduce you to Crammut, a platform where teams can create, keep track and complete learning paths. 

Who is Crammut for

We think Crammut is perfect for teams who need a faster way to train employees in a specific field of knowledge but lack the time to keep track of their progress. Crammut is the perfect place to arrange the content you‚Äôve always wanted to read or watch -- Medium posts, Youtube videos, Reddit threads, book titles, etc. -- and set a deadline to learn from it.

How to use Crammut

Create a learning path from scratch or pick one from our public library. Assign this learning path you yourself or to a member of your team et voil√†! The different tasks will be automatically scheduled. Every time you complete a task from the learning path, you will be rewarded with coins, which you can use to complete a card collection. After you finish a learning path, you can rate it and store it in your own private company library for others to use.

The Crammut Manifesto - How lifelong learning spaces at work kill enterprise status quo: https://medium.com/@crammut/the-crammut-manifesto-how-lifelong-learning-spaces-at-work-kill-enterprise-status-quo-98cd0f645779
@duiker101 Hi Simone! First of all thank you so much for reaching us, specially because in order to find us you had to browse the entire 'Newest' section lol. 

Let me put it this way -- Crammut is a platform where you create a list with formal and informal resources (that's what we call a 'learning path') to learn about it and assign it to yourself or other people in your company, i.e. imagine you want to know about SEO. You would collect all the formal and informal content you can find on the web (blog posts, Youtube videos, Quora or Reddit threads, even a Udemy course), create a list of all these contents and assign it to yourself. The platform will automatically schedule each item throughout your week so you don't forget to learn about it. Finally, you rate this learning path to let other users of the platform (from your company) if this was useful or not.

The best thing about Crammut is that you can keep track of your team. For example, you can see who is learning what, who has assigned more learning paths and who hasn't, which learning paths are more popular and useful and so on. 

There are some learning paths that we have created in order to encourage people to use Crammut, but users can create their own learning paths too. Our value resides not in the content we post on the platform but the platform itself and the statistics you have to check your team's progress. 

I hope my answer helps! Thank you again for your time. :)";4;-3;True;True;False;creativity

PyroHabit is different : shape good money habits, memorize your expenses, track where they go, reach financial goals etc. - in a simple and secured manner.";2;-1;True;False;False;Long;Short;No;No;The web app to save more and attain financial freedom.;Long;No;No;No;Yes;1;No;No;Yes;1197691;Basile Samel;Yes;Yes;Low;Few;No;1197691;Basile Samel;Yes;Yes;Low;Yes;"Hello dear Hunters :)

I am Basile, the maker of PyroHabit ??

Leaving college, I started wondering how much money would be enough money so that I don't work till my 70's, like most of my generation and the next ones probably will. I started reading blogs on personal finance, more specifically the <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com"">Mister Money Moustache</a> blog.

During my end-of-study internship, I saved aggressively around 75% of my income at the time, by tracking my expenses in a google spreadsheet, developing good spending habits and living more simply.

https://pyrohabit.com/ph_launch/google_calc.png

Saving is nice, but you need to invest what you save. So I decided to invest in myself : since the beginning of this month,  I am using all those savings to travel the world while launching my own tech products remotely as an indie maker. PyroHabit is the first one. 

PyroHabit is a tool to help me reach an even greater freedom, by replacing my messy spreadsheets and adding new layers - to save (or start saving), the smart way. What PyroHabit does at the moment : 

? List of expenses
(sort expenses by date, import/export in CSV, AES-256 encrypted data) 
https://pyrohabit.com/ph_launch/screen2.jpg

? Financial goals
(recurring or time-bounded spending goals, retirement calculator)
https://pyrohabit.com/ph_launch/screen3.jpg

? Charts
(evolution of expenses by category over time)
https://pyrohabit.com/ph_launch/screen1.jpg

?Ô∏è Unlimited custom categories
https://pyrohabit.com/ph_launch/screen4.jpg

PyroHabit is a product that I want to be open and collaborative, so I build it using this public Trello board : <a href=""https://trello.com/b/q8GGtfEr/pyrohabit"">link</a>. You can see there what I am currently trying to improve and where the product is heading.

For now, PyroHabit uses gamification (points, statuses ...) to help you develop spending habits.
The next milestone would be to use community and public accountability : making saving and simplicity the new cool by sharing your metrics and trying to improve with others. I plan to release this update next month, so feel free to register just to see how I am trying to push the boundaries of budgeting softwares.

What you can do now however, product hunters, is to use the PRODUCT HUNT coupon code to get 1 month of PyroHabit premium for free ? (go to Pricing -> Premium plan -> Go Premium and enter the coupon code when registering)

Thank you for reading me and I hope PyroHabit will be as helpful for you as it is for me !

As a web developer, I always found the accessibility guidelines to be pretty confusing, and quite difficult to interpret at times. It would be ideal if you could just run your website through a tool that checked it against the guidelines, but that isn't possible. A lot of the guidelines check for things that cannot be determined programmatically, like whether there are clear validation errors in a form.

With MAWD, I've taken the accessibility guidelines and transformed them into a decision engine to determine whether there are any issues. MAWD asks you, the developer, questions when it is unsure. It takes the analysis of the page content and your responses to give you an accessibility report. This report explains clearly what each issue is and how to fix it.  

For the beta, MAWD only covers 4 of the WCAG guidelines, but there will be more coming soon. 
It's got a month's free trial, so plenty of time for you to give it a try and fix up a website.

I really hope that MAWD will help make the web more accessible for all.

4 months ago I‚Äôve shared with you Cards for Webflow, first ever UI Kit right after Webflow allowed copy and pasting between projects. Within couple of months you‚Äôve cloned this project over 1500 times and put it with your upvotes as a top 1 on Webflow Showcase in clonable products. So to give back for this amazing support I‚Äôve decided to completely rethink the cards and come up with a massive update. As I‚Äôm writing this message I‚Äôve just pressed ‚ÄúPublish to Showcase gallery‚Äù for my new product CARDS 2.0 Framework/UI Kit for Webflow!

Cards 2.0 are Symbol based Framework/UI Kit for quick design or wireframe of your next landing page project. 100 symbols/elements ready for design or hi-fidelity wireframe for any UI/UX designers or developers out there. All comes with a easy to use Webflow file. The main goal of this project is to help you - Webflow users - with creating beautiful landing pages or wireframes within minutes directly in Webflow with ready to be published code. All again with a coded styleguide for all the main typography elements (H1-H6, links, paragraphs etc.) buttons, tags you name it. 

What you get/Package overview:
50 New Cards as Webflow Symbols (in 2 versions Dark and Light = 100 Symbols)
3 Complete landing pages in 2 versions
Symbols for Hero sections, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, Team, Blog and more.
Ready for all 4 responsive breakpoint 
Cards from v1.0 recreated into a new structure
All cards in Sketch file
All of this based on beautiful designs crafted using roughly 10 core elements (7 text styles and 3 buttons) to keep the visual language super simple and easy to understand. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This package can do great things for:

Developers: simply take every style and visual language out of this package with you cmd+c cmd+v to be able create stuff instead of being in charge of designs. No need to be worried anymore if you have the correct line-height or if the colors are working together nicely. 

UI Designers: by giving them a library of section and code help them create stuff quickly just by pasting their assets into ready sections to really reduce the time of creating landing pages for their clients or projects. 

UX Designers: with the right elements which can be quickly moved this around and help testing different approaches on their users. Or just to quickly prepare visual structure to present ideas to their stakeholders.
(Obviously it would be better to remove all the ‚Äúreal-pixels‚Äù from the sections to make this a real wireframing package. I might do that in some upcoming update. Or you guys can do that with me! ??)

First time users: explore the possibilities of simple layouts in Webflow copy paste anything into their future projects.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

And that‚Äôs it :) All of this is again for FREE and ready to be cloned or downloaded. I‚Äôll be super excited to see any of your results based on this framework, so feel free to send anything you‚Äôve done with Cards 2.0 at @janlosert or me@janlosert.com

Hi Paul,

This is a good question.

""All mobile devices have built-in processors at the audio output port. It pulls out all the sounds, however, and the speakers of the devices are unable to reproduce the sounds at high volumes with high quality. Perhaps you will be surprised at how awfully bad and wrong something sounds that you quite liked listening to with your computer.""

That's the truth - loud audio files are sounds very distorted on mobile speakers. It's recommended to use quiet sounds for UI. And sometimes it's ok to use loud sounds for notifications, but you should be careful and pick the right sound.";3;-4;True;True;False;creativity

This is my first launch on this awesome place ?

Few weeks ago I started going extreme & literally coded for longer periods of time & after 9 hours of rigorous coding my eyes were paining a lot. Although I drink a lot of water, it still didn't help my eyes & they were still dehydrated.

Few weeks ago I found out Aware & I loved it. Only it was missing a few features. So I went ahead & made them myself & <b>Away From Keyboard</b> is that product.

It is my 2nd product of the <a href=""https://akshaykadam.me/blog/72-hours-product/"">72 hours product</a> challenge. 

My 1st product was <a href=""https://akshaykadam.me/apps/wip-desktop/"">WIP Desktop</a> - A Desktop App made in Electron for https://wip.chat but I didn't launch it here because it was too niche.

I tweeted about building it here - https://twitter.com/deadcoder0904/status/1023822696503799808

Although I didn't make one in under 72 hours yet, as learning new libraries & language takes time I am sure I will be able to build it in the future.

This is my first Swift app & I didn't know Swift before doing this. So learned it & launched this.

Here's the complete thread from development to production -

https://twitter.com/deadcoder0904/status/1031054115269488641

Here's how it looks like -

<b>Complete Screenshot with all the details about the app</b>

https://imgur.com/IYZJHwa.png

So what exactly is <b>Away From Keyboard (AFK)</b> ?

AFK is a Mac only app which reduces eye strain with reminders to take a break.

AFK tracks movements on the mouse & keystrokes on the keyboard. After a certain interval, it notifies you to take a break & tells you to do some other activity to reduce eye strain. It takes care of your eyes for you without getting in the way.

Whether you are a developer, a designer, a gamer or anyone who uses computer for more than 2 hours, you should take breaks often & rest your eyes, every 2 hours, for example.

AFK notifes you when you are using your computer for too long & tells you to do an activity so that you get away from your keyboard ?

Startup Jobs is a search engine for startup jobs. Every day we crawl 1.000's of startup sites to check for new job openings. At any given time we list around 35,000 job openings ranging from junior designer jobs to startups looking for a CTO.

There's a powerful <a href=""https://www.algolia.com"">Algolia</a>-powered search engine which lets you find exactly the job that fits you. Some example searches:

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://startup.jobs/junior"">? Junior jobs</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://startup.jobs/collections/female-founders"">? Jobs at startups founded by women</a></li>

</ul>
The site might look familiar to some. About two years ago I started jobs section on BetaList called <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/betalist-jobs"">BetaList Jobs</a>. It seemed like a good way to kickstart a job board and add an additional revenue model. Since then I've made a lot of improvements.

The site now feels grown up enough to warrant its own brand so I've recently decided to spin it off into its own brand.

Some of the updates include:
<ul>
<li>Improved design that's also optimised for mobile</li>
<li>Better performance (faster front-end and back-end)</li>

Shout out to @levelsio for sharing everything he learned building <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/remote-ok"">Remote OK</a>, the <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/work-in-progress-2"">WIP</a> community for their feedback, <a href=""https://www.algolia.com"">Algolia</a> for powering the blazing fast search, @RPISH for taking care of BetaList so I could focus my efforts on Startup Jobs, and all the Startup Jobs customers for enabling me to bootstrap the business.

Looking forward to your feedback!
@wimgz The job posts are sourced from the individual startups' career sites. This is more work, but it ensures we have the most up-to-date information.
@tillrahn The site was hosted on a different domain until recently. So the reason you see a traffic jump from zero to something in a short amount of time is because that's when I switched the site to the new domain. In reality it took about two years to grow the site to where it is today. Unfortunately there are no short cuts.
@ol_podol Good question. I use a broad definition of startup. In the future I'll add a filter so you can choose to just see early-stage, late-stage, etc.
@rafyasarmatta Thanks ?
@tillrahn Yeah I'm using 301 redirects so I keep the 'SEO juice' I built on on the previous URLs.

To answer your second question: paid job posts rank higher. Long-term I plan to mimic Google Search's model where we aim to include all relevant content, but display paid posts more prominently.
@igityan_hayarpy all :)
@rrhoover Thanks, I'm very happy I was able to acquire it. It was being used by another job board, but I noticed their site hadn't been updated in a while so I offered to buy it for a reasonable price.

Besides it being memorable and giving immediate 'weight' to the brand, my hope was that it would also help me rank for the search term ""startup jobs"".  It seems to be working as it's already included on the first Google SERP for most people.

Hoping to be neighbours soon (AngelList has a very solid #1 spot.)
@eekayonline Thanks Edwin!
@rrhoover I'd rather not share that at this point. Perhaps someday :)

First off, thanks to @chrismessina for hunting Merrier! I‚Äôm really excited to be launching it on Product Hunt!  

Merrier is an app that turns overcoming your anxiety into a game. You can:

? Set quests: Set your worries as quests and set off to beat them 
? Win rewards: Win coins, trophies, and more for completing quests and milestones
? Track your progress: Track your progress along maps and charts of your journey

So why did I make Merrier? After gathering feedback from those with anxiety, I found they wanted the benefits of existing apps, like tracking progress, but they also wanted something more fun, positive and most importantly ‚Äî actionable. ?

This makes sense. Games are fun, interactive and motivating. I want people to be as excited about improving their mental health as they are playing games. But, I also want them to see clear progress. Hence why along with the game setting, Merrier uses proven techniques like CBT. You can read more about that here: https://merrier.apptaste.co/the-science/. 

So, let me know what you think! Any feedback is welcome ‚Äî I want to make this app as helpful as possible. ?

Thanks for the question! Love the Product Hunt Platform, and we're a big fan of all Product Hunters!!


 We started with why: We realized that social media isn't social any more. You'll likely never hear anybody ever saying that they had a great time on Facebook Saturday night. Social Media platforms are built to keep you on the social media platforms. 

This is in my opinion why Joyn'it differs from the rest. We are dedicated solely to hangouts, group activities and events and we do not run ads on Joyn'it. Our biggest metric for success is how many times you get out of the house and hang out with those that you care about. So we don't care how much time you spend on Joyn'it (although we make it fun for you while you do) - we care about how often you're getting out of the house and doing fun stuff. 

For the individual user, we're super proud of the fact that when inviting your friends to hang out, you don't have to bother with Doodle polls anymore to figure out when they're free  because Joyn'it has a Smart Date Finder that tells you when people are available (thanks to the calendar integration feature we've added to the platform). 

For Community users, we have the ability to create communities with as many individuals subscribed to your community as you like. What I'm proudest of is that Joyn'it provides community organizers to decide whether or not they want to active or passively promote their event. If they choose to passively promote their event, then all community members will be able to see the next community event on their Event Feeds. If they choose to actively promote their event, all community members will receive a notification for the next event! 

Each event has a dedicated event page like a website that you might create for your event as well. This includes a super intuitive discussion section that is available to all attendees!

This eliminates the need for email back and forth. Currently, most people use several different platforms to create, organize and promote their hangouts and events. They use Doodle to find out when people are available, they use Group chats such as Whatsapp to discuss locations and talk about whether or not people will come to the event, they use Facebook to create larger scale events, and then they have to manually add all events into their calendars. 

Joyn'it allows you to do all that in one single platform in a super intuitive way. 

That's a brief overview of why I'm proud of our company -  Joyn'it!  

I would encourage all of you to sign up by downloading the app (www.dl.joynit.io) or by using our web app: www.app.joynit.io

Sign in with the sponsor code SIDDYG to connect with me, or with the Sponsor code ""NewJoyner"" to connect with a community of new Joyners on Joyn'it! Create your events and get out of your house.

You can already do that with an admitted less marketed feature called 'Hooks'. We probably need to work on making and marketing it better. It'll let you migrate your new emails as soon as a backup is completed giving you more redundancies (and more Horcruxes ?). The idea is something like Zapier.

Imagine knowing exactly WHO to email and, more importantly, HOW to email them so that they actually want to reply to your email.

I've spent the last few years working in business development, sales, career development, and content marketing and have found one thing to be pretty true:

Most people write awful emails.

Even people who have a ton to offer - they end up torpedoing themselves because they write emails that are hard to read, hard to understand, and hard to reply to.

So my team put together all of my best free content on writing great emails and compiled them into Email Academy.

This is your PERSONAL LIBRARY to access email scripts, teardowns, and understanding how to craft that PERFECT email.

I'm Tony Tong, a soon-to-graduate college student from Singapore, and this is my <b>first ever product launch</b> I've done on my own to prove to myself that I can ship products to help people.

After working on this project for 5 months juggling a tech internship and schoolwork, I'm happy to be able to launch and move closer to my 2020 goal of generating >$5k/ month building indie products on @ProductHunt, complete internships in Bali and China/ Unites States, while graduating from @NUSingapore 

<b>My vision is to help people develop greater self-awareness and clearer thinking skills through mental models.</b>

The wise businessman Charlie Munger often said:

<i>‚ÄúIt is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.‚Äù</i>

How he does this is through mental models, a latticework of concepts in one‚Äôs head that exponentially improves one‚Äôs odds of success.

However, the biggest obstacles to a high-performing latticework are <b>cognitive biases</b>, default errors in our thinking that leads us down the wrong roads. 

Personally witnessing entrepreneurial friends lose months (if not years), $1000s of dollars and 1000 energy bars from their blind spots, I've found it disheartening to see.

Hence, I've distilled my past experiences in 5 startups, my own 6-figure marketing agency and a tech role in Silicon Valley into a 4-part email to help you avoid the mistakes many have made (many I have made myself).

If you are a learning machine into mental models, systems-thinking and self-help, then this newsletter should be of service to you.

Any advice is accepted with open arms!¬†ÔøºÔøº?

Tony Tong";3;-2;True;True;False;creativity

Another thing we could possibly do is introduce the company to a new candidate as a reward for giving feedback.

Would love to hear other ideas we may be missing on how to incentivize / partner with companies to encourage them to give feedback ?
@pingrivero Yes, we agree that most hiring processes really lack a good feedback loop.

As for getting recruiters/employers to actually give feedback, we've thought a lot about different ways to incentivize them to give feedback. See this comment for some of the ideas we have: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/after-interview#comment-665880 If anything comes to mind that we're missing though, would love to hear your thoughts ?
@stephmcdonald We've mostly thought about different ways to incentivize companies to give feedback (see https://www.producthunt.com/posts/after-interview#comment-665880). 

Introducing some kind of a release for the candidate to sign is a very intriguing idea though, that is not part of the app currently. We'll have to explore that more. Thanks for the insight ?
@igityan_hayarpy Yes, it could certainly be used for university interviews ?
@roland_hovsepyan ?thanks
@jhm_uk We've thought about allowing the candidate to give feedback to the company, and only allowing the company to view that feedback if they give feedback back to the candidate.

Something that your comment brings to mind is allowing that process to start in reverse order. So the company gives feedback to the candidate, and the candidate can only view that feedback if they give feedback back to the company. This is something we can definitely explore, b/c both sides would really benefit from feedback.

Thanks for the comment and don't hesitate to let us know of any other thoughts or questions you have ?

I'm really excited to announce a product I've been building on and off since the last period. Grapedrop is a single page builder which allows you to create quickly web pages for your landing pages, products and more.

The project is based on GrapesJS (https://grapesjs.com/), an open source, web builder framework I've created years ago and still trying to maintain. So this is also kind of a litmus test for what I've been creating so far, but there is still more yet to come.

The goal I'd like to reach with Grapedrop is to make the creation of web projects easy for everyone, with no coding skill required, but, at the same time, output a high-quality production ready result. I know I'm not the only one with such a purpose but I think we're still far from it, so if you have any kind of suggestion, I'd really appreciate to hear it :)

The free tier offers also a lot feature that you hardly find in other similar projects (full feature editor, forms, code export, custom code, etc.). Grapedrop is now in beta and it's a really early product with a plenty of room for improvement, but if you like it and believe in this project the Premium plan is kind of an ""investment"" (with a LIFETIME Beta Discount) which would help me to make it better.

I've written a blog post on how Drafty came about, but the short story was I have been asked to write several guest posts but there wasn't an easy, simple, tool that would allow me to write the content, share & allow people to modify, that met my requirements.

Features include:

- Kanban-style board to allow you to manage your content
- Super easy content editor (based on Medium editor)
- No authentication needed for reviewers
- Share draft content with a button, add a message and send an email automatically

Drafty is currently free, and am working towards a pricing model (will always have a free plan, but am thinking pro + team plans).

@owenfar1 I think only partly, you should be able to access it, but not anyone else. This feature is still in early stages, but if you have a look at the web settings we offer a ""autodelete"" functionality. Currently this feature is still very young, but eventually it will secure your browsing, and help you keep access to your resources, but then in a secured environment.
@retendo Hey Oliver! Yes this is possible, you can simply login to the extensions, en pause it. This way it will ignore anything you do, then to add pages you can use the context menu and select ""add to favorites"" I think that would do the trick? 

Also keep in mind you are fully in control of you information, so if you delete records they're gone completely.

While working on a project, a Spring-based web application, it quickly became annoying adding the same log statements for each new controller method being created.

This is my first product on PH and I'm super excited to show my platform. As a developer I'm very aware of companies that track my internet behaviour. So for my own websites I was looking for a tool that would provide me the analytics I needed, but without giving all my visitors data to a big corporate.

That's how Simple Analytics was born and it shows you

?Pageviews by your visitors
?A list of where people are coming from
?A list of the most popular pages
?Device dimensions

All this, without compromising the privacy of your user.

I hope you like my first PH product and I'm open to all the feedback you have!
@wimgz Thanks! Google is hiding this info in the referrer, so the only way would be connecting with Google Developer Tools. I will look into that!
@petecodes Thanks for the support! And let me know if I can help you with anything.
@nooruzzonline these are good points. I do have to watch out not becoming an overloaded platform with way too much information. Maybe I will create a foldout with extra info or something like that. Thanks for the feedback, really appreciate it.

Our product is simple and physically unassuming, yet it demonstrates stopping power leaps and bounds beyond most ballistic products, and is engineered to be as easy to use as an app.

Like most people, I couldn‚Äôt imagine a life without my phone. It helps me stay connected with loved ones, look up recipes for dinner, watch funny puppy videos, and not get lost. But, like most people as well, I sometimes feel like my phone is taking over my life. 

In fact, when we looked at data from current RescueTime users, we found that most people spend more than 3 hours on their phone and can‚Äôt go 3 minutes without checking them! Personally, I spend about 15 hours per week looking at my phone, which shocked me when I saw the data.

That‚Äôs why we spent the last few years updating and creating a new RescueTime Mobile experience.

These three 3D scanning technology reinforce and improve each other. Thus, the Scoobe3D allows you to scan every material seamlessly - even specular surfaces. This way, you can create accurate 3D models without the need of post processing. 

Additionally, the Scoobe3D app is easy and intuitive to use with onscreen instructions on how to move the 3D scanner. Generating a 3D model is as easy as capturing a pano photo: you just circumvent the object once.

The posts give both a consumer and a VC review on the product. The account was started by a London-based VC, Jenny Gyllander from Backed, to enlighten your meme filled instafeed! ü•ë

Hunter Walk called her ""The Best VC on Instagram"".";2;-2;True;True;False;Long;Short;No;Yes;Product reviews on Instagram by a VC;Medium;No;Yes;No;Yes;1;No;No;Yes;269621;Abadesi;Yes;No;Low;Few;Yes;365296;Jenny Gyllander;Yes;Yes;Low;Yes;"Thank you @abadesi for hunting Thingtesting. I feel like I‚Äôm being blessed with one ‚ÄúHunter‚Äù after the other, hehe (ping @hunterwalk).

Here‚Äôs why I started Thingtesting as a side project 6 months ago:

‚úîÔ∏èI was curious: When I moved to London a year ago I had this magical list of products that I couldn‚Äôt wait to try. Birchbox, mattresses, you name it (not many could be purchased where I lived prior to moving to London). My colleagues at Backed endured me raving about new and some not-that-new products for months; Amazon Prime(!), Sofar Sounds, Glossier London pop-ups. One day when I was trying out Psycle, London‚Äôs version of Soulcycle, I realised that I can‚Äôt bother my friends and colleagues with more ‚Äúyoushouldcheckthisout‚Äù and needed a channel to do so. I bought some foam board in an art shop, my flatmate gave me a crash course in photoshop and I started shooting. I‚Äôve been doing that on evenings and weekends ever since.

‚úîÔ∏è It made sense: I chose Instagram as my channel because it feels like home to me. Some of the companies I admire the most use Instagram as a prime channel to drive growth. I see my friends setting up companies and they have instagram accounts before they even have websites. Why are no VCs on Instagram, when so many companies are born there?

‚úîÔ∏èNew audience: While I test and review new products, I try to do my best to demystify some VC thinking. I also hope that Thingtesting can speak to another audience than most VC blogs, so that a more people would get involved and interested in startups and VC. 

As for new products I‚Äôd love to review? I‚Äôm planning some themed weeks at the moment: Sleep, meat substitutes, productivity, travel and sex. I cannot wait to get my hands on a Mirror, for___days t-shirts, New Wave Foods (fake shrimp), Rothy‚Äôs shoes, plus I guess it‚Äôs due time to get my hands on some Kylie Cosmetics‚Ä¶ That magical list of mine today has more than 150+ companies... I want to start to test experiences too (Museum of Pizza in NYC!). Abadesi, your idea on AR/VR makes a lot of sense for experiences hmm‚Ä¶ IGTV, stay tuned ?

I have one rule on Thingtesting: 100% honesty. So now it‚Äôs your turn to be 100% honest! Thoughts, feedback? 

And also - what are the best emerging brands that have I missed? Who should be featured on Thingtesting? I promise to review the top 3 products suggested in the comments!

@rrhoover is doing a guest post on Thingtesting today at 8AM PDT  - what product do you think he will review? ?
@hunterwalk @pimdewitte1 Aw, thank you Pim! ?

Here's a few of my fav VCs doing a great job of exploring new ways of content: @harrystebbings @ntdillon @wolfejosh @n_sportelli @naval 

Also curious to hear what others have to say!
@seffa121 Thank you @seffa121, means a lot :) Followers ask for long-form content and video. Founders behind the products ask for advice and support on all things D2C (especially European founders, I think US might be further ahead). VCs ask for insights into my DMs ?

@roland_hovsepyan thank you, glad you like it!
@nooruzzonline thank you and happy to have you onboard ?
@amrith Thank you :) This has all happened so fast that I haven't really thought about other mediums, one keeps me busy enough heh.. But there's for sure some limitations with Instagram like character length (2200) and it's hard to capture non-physical products. Quite curious about IGTV but got to work on my confidence to feel influencery-enough to be there ?
@thisiskp_ thank you! :) let me know what emerging products and brands that I've missed!
@tostartafire A lot of ads you are right - but to be clear; I don't get paid for these reviews and the only rule on my page is 100% honesty. Guest posts by other investors cannot for example be investors in the products that they review.
@alexwinkyface Thank you! Would love if you could share some of those accounts? I've found a few like Wirecutter and many in the beauty space, but nothing really focused on startups. Let me know if you have time to share :)

Hello @mtatay! Thank you for your respond! The problem of each task tracker is that each team wants to create something completely new, as a result, development is delayed for many years, but few can keep up with the old products in this market. For them, there is little integration and above the entry threshold. 

We have Trello, which meets the requirements of the majority, it already includes integration with all services and it's convenient to use. Our team offers to extend the functionality of Trello with the help of a gantt chart. We are also trying to make it affordable for small and growing teams, so we have one of the lowest prices on the market, provided this remains a powerful tool.

Many teams expand their staff to large sizes, and all these employees need to pay their salaries. On the contrary, we want to add people to our team only when absolutely necessary, because the technologies that we will use allow us to accelerate the development several times and make it the minimum number of employees. This gives our team a huge advantage.

We‚Äôre excited to introduce Jibility: a cloud-based app that makes it fast and simple to build a strategy roadmap for your business. 

A strategy roadmap is a powerful tool that‚Äôs often overlooked or neglected because of how complex and time-consuming it can be to create one. It‚Äôs essentially the missing link between a business strategy and the actual execution and answers the question ‚Äòwhere the hell do I start?‚Äô

Jibility guides you through six steps to make creating a strategy roadmap quick. Each step is highly visual and constructed by dragging and dropping, heatmapping, defining the links and labelling priorities. 

The story behind the app: 
After being round the block a time or two (or dozen), two Aussie business and technology consultants started to notice patterns in the challenges faced by companies of all sizes, all ages and all industries. Having an awesome strategy is one thing, but successfully executing is a different ballgame and there‚Äôs often a daunting gap in between. Our guys ‚Äì Chris and Chuen ‚Äì saw the opportunity for a tool that was affordable, simple, and let businesses truly own strategy and success.

Let us know if you have any questions about the product, and all feedback of course welcome!

It's a super simple concept - make your order online and pick it up in-store. 

Why Clickup is different:
- No need for your customers to download another app - stores get their own short url.
- Setup really does take minutes, add products and photos with you iPhone.
- Totally customisable - your logo, not ours.
- Low cost and no setup.

We've resisted the temptation to create a marketplace - instead we want to be an awesome lightweight SaaS for small businesses. Think of Click-up like a POS but on users' phones :)

We're testing with a handful of locations, and would love to hear what you think!

Hi hunters,
Cheqqly is an app that helps any app, web maker, online business get paid from US/EU or anywhere.
Becoming a successful maker means  having lots of users from other parts of the world but when it gets to monetize your product, it gets almost impossible to launch there.
Here are the following problems you land in to:
- Your credit or debit card gets rejected by payment platform you wanted to use e.g Stripe
- Incorporating in US or EU is freaking expensive and it costs at a minimal $5000 plus travel expenses, legal issues.
- Frustrating, other existing solutions are $900+ budget

At Cheqqly we want to change all that i.e :
- Build a universal payment online POS (widget)
- You pay for what you use at 1.9% + 30¬¢
-  Use your preferred money transfer system to get your money.
- Free, open and fast
- The platform can be used to pay for other services where cards got rejected e.g G-suite rejects my card, Reddit ads etc

Importantly, we're departing from Clara's traditional conversational UX for this feature.

Service List is a collection of companies (many pulled from Product Hunt!) that offer unlimited services for a fixed monthly fee. The current focus is design services but we‚Äôv‚Äôe started adding writing, development and marketing services also.

? The ""Background""
We started using Many Pixels for our various side project tasks with a lot of success, which sparked our curiosity for other unlimited services. With a bit research we found that the unlimited services market is growing very, very fast and we decided to build Service List as a way to keep track of this industry while also providing a resource for entrepreneurs to easily compare different service options.

? The Roadmap
Thanks for all the questions thus far but the focus is primarily on design for 2018 then we‚Äôll expand the other categories early next year.
- Design Samples: We‚Äôre going to test the services anonymously with the same design brief so that we can make comparisons on aesthetics, communication, and turn around time.
- Reviews (@abadesi) - We‚Äôll open up customer reviews for the design categories with manual moderation (require samples?)
- Build a Startup $1000 - Experiment to build a product using only unlimited services companies.

@itsarnavb I had 2 main goals designing Berkanan. 1Ô∏è‚É£ I wanted it to work in the background, not just only when the app was active.

For this I needed to implement encryption on my own (using Apple's frameworks) since I didn't get the encryption that comes with Bluetooth pairing. I made this part <a href=""https://github.com/zssz/BerkananKit/"">available on GitHub</a> since I wanted to make the app's use of encryption transparent. I hope I've satisfied your appetite. ?

@nolvia_serrano @kareem_c Currently you can only send text messages. The range between 2 devices in perfect conditions is about 70 meters (230 feet). Messages travel from device to device. In practice that means your messages can reach further than 70 m (230 ft).

I recently sold my first bootstrapped SaaS.

It wasn't the success of my life.

However, building that product, marketing it to over 7000 users and helping hundreds of them be better at sales - was by far one of the most experience-rich journeys of my life.

I'm super grateful for all of the challenges and lessons throughout that journey.

To close that chapter and share my appreciation I decided to put all the marketing knowledge and experience I gained in the last couple of years in an eBook.

I don't know what your opinion is on horizontal scrollbars but in the era of responsive design, I think it can look unprofessional.

It can be tough to spot horizontal overflow on macOS, especially since scrollbars are hidden until you scroll (and who tries to horizontally scroll a web page). Among other things, horizontal scrollbars may cause unexpected behavior or poor UX in some cases.

Even if you spot the problem, finding the element responsible for it can be tricky if the page contains lots of elements. This exact thing happened to me one time and it took me about 15 minutes to find out what caused the overflow.

After seeing horizontal scrollbars on two of my friends' websites (who use macOS) and remembering that time I debugged such a simple thing for way too long, I decided to make a tiny extension that solves the problem.

Hope you find it useful!

I'm the sole developer of this game called ??? ""Robo Galactic Wars"" ??? 

As mentioned earlier, this game was a part of ""JS13k Challenge"" with a theme called ""Offline"". This is my first video game I've developed since college after 7-8 years, with some 80s style retro gaming and synthwave galactic ambience. ? 

This is all keyboard-based shooting game (will be supporting mouse and joystick soon). Also, there's only one character (The Green Quantum Robot) to be played with. Few more characters will be developed in next version with different speed and strength.

Arrow Keys - Menu Toggle/Robot Movement
Enter - Confirm/Continue
Space - Shoot
P - Pause/Resume Game

--- Story ---
Your planet is under threat as the asteroids are approaching with uncertain speed. Your mission is to destroy them all before your battery is drained out completely and making you ""offline"" permanently. However, you can look for golden stars to recharge battery. 

Each round has a target number of asteroids to be destroyed. Once you reach the target, you'll be promoted to next round with even higher target to chase. You can play upto 50 rounds. Beyond that, you can still play more, score more and try to beat the game by ""flipping"" the score back to 0.

It's all about your survival. ? 

I bet you will find this game addicted ?. Please show your support by all means:
- Share this app on all social platforms as much as possible.
- Send feedbacks/suggestions with love or hate by tweeting to yours truly a.k.a The Savior Game-Maker: https://twitter.com/CreativeBakchod.

Moreover, this is an open-source project. You can contribute on Github: https://github.com/AshBardhan/robo-galactic-shooter.

I'll be very excited to read suggestions, comments, feature/update requests in future. And don't forget to share your score online. ?";4;-4;True;True;False;creativity

I am thrilled to share this project I have been working on for many months now. I have been fascinated by mental models ever since I read the Almanack of Charlie Munger. My pure fascination with this concept merely has been due to giving me an ability to think independently. Using a multi-disciplinary approach to understand things around me has been really advantageous. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and so many others have applied this kind of concept of multi-disciplinary approach to learn and broaden their thinking. 

As much as it has been fun to build the product, learn about mental models, I really want to teach mental models. So, I have been writing extensively about these mental models. You can find it here: https://medium.com/@HeyWiseCharlie/inversion-4408849657fc. I have also open sourced all mental models here https://github.com/wisecharlie/. 

The motivation to build this product was to help myself initially. I was the customer but then I thought why not share with others who may benefit from this as well. So, I selected most of the models that Charlie mentioned in this text, shortened each mental model in its most simplistic definition, followed by a humorous example and a beautiful illustration explaining the model. They are beautiful for work desk, coffee table or bookshelf. I have placed a deck everywhere so I am surrounded by them. 

Why 100 mental models only? In Charlie's words, ""80 or 90 important models will carry about 90% of the freight in making you a worldly wise person.""

Here is a special Product Hunt 10% discount (PH212018) if you are interested in purchasing the deck of cards. They are beautiful, short and funny. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you @geetfun! I appreciate your kind words. It is alright. This is a very long-term project so I'll be back with a strong storytelling. If you don't mind, please share the project with your network.";4;-2;True;True;False;creativity

Super excited to launch this (and very tired)

YOU DON'T NEED WORDPRESS:

Every time I log into Wordpress, my head hurts. 

I love Google Docs so I had the shower thought to use Google Drive as a CMS for a blog. I wanted to build something:

?Dead simple and easy to use
?Get set up in a breeze
?Start writing immediately!
?Access to powerful Google Docs features
‚öôÔ∏èHighly customizable (tables, shapes, charts export with ease)
?No markdown
?Open source

Cool example: Export native gDocs charts, tables, formatting with ease: https://www.youdontneedwp.com/patwalls/4

HOW I BUILT THIS:

I set a goal to build and launch this product in 24 HOURS! I live streamed the whole process on Twitch! [Recorded live stream ? https://www.twitch.tv/videos/313288148]

5,000 people came to watch the live stream!

It was nerve-racking and epic to have thousands of people watch me program, provide feedback, and ask questions. Special thanks to @alec_joness and many others!

P.S. I'm sorry my Google API account is not fully approved/verified - I sent in the application and should hear back soon.

Thanks for reading and let me know any feedback you have on the product!
@camerondare Thanks Cam and I agree - most importantly it was just a really fun experience.
@levelsio Thank you ?? You are one of my biggest inspirations Pietz!
@deadcoder0904 Thank you my man. I had this idea in the back of my head for a while.

I was on a run the other day, and I realized I had no plans on the weekend... So I wrote that tweet and it kinda blew up. Idk if I would have pulled through without everyone's support yesterday! So much fun!
@andreyazimov thank you! sheet2site.com was a huge inspiration for this project. I'm thinking of adding a pro plan if enough people like the project.
@stephenfjohnson Thank you for hanging out on the stream I couldn't have shipped it all without you. Now your turn!! ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è
@harianus Thanks Adriaan ?
@petecodes Yes!! Custom domain, analytics, remove branding. If enough people like the project then maybe I can charge for a pro plan.
@morajabi Ah dude ?Yeah I've had a notion of the idea for a while. Stoked to just get it done and out of my system in one day!
@derkinzi Nope nothing too crazy! The gDoc exports formatted html with inline styles. It's cool because it can format tons of stuff from the gDoc like colors, shapes, etc.

The only thing I had to do was rip out the <html> and <body> tags and it works quite nicely.

For example, Google will export a gDocs chart to an image automatically - see this example: https://www.youdontneedwp.com/patwalls/4
@adamscochran Yes thank you! Yeah I wanted to implement a paid plan but I just ran out of time in my 24 hour challenge.

I'm thinking custom domain, analytics, and removing branding for a monthly fee. Thoughts?
@nhatphuong Yes I know. Sorry, since I built this in 24 hours, I didn't have time to get my Google API account verified. I'm working on it right now. Should be back soon.

The idea behind DebugBear is to watch pages as they load and then use that data to help developers understand what's going on. That can mean finding out when a new third party script was added, or when a new error message started appearing in the console.

One feature I'm very happy with is the JS bundle monitoring: you can see a graph for each bundle and it takes into account that the bundle hash changes over time.

I look forward to your feedback! If you're interested in using the product I can also work directly with you to make sure your needs are met.";3;-2;True;True;False;community

I made a little bot to post the top 5 products of the day on Twitter. Here's why:

? <b>Problem</b>
I love to browse PH for new products, but I'm too busy to check it every day.
Since I use email mostly for work, I often don't read the daily/weekly recap sent by email.
So I'm missing out on all the good things happening on Product Hunt!
And often I miss the launch of the coolest products!

? <b>Solution</b>
I needed a way for PH posts to find me during my ""distraction time"".
No matter how busy I am, I find myself checking Twitter at some point.
So I made a bot that posts the top 5 products of the day on Twitter.

I use the API to get the top 5 posts.
Thanks @ProductHunt for making it open! ?
This way I always see what's hot on PH and the bot gives me the link to know more 

How do you like it?

Raghav here and I'd love to answer your questions.

Our journey started here just a few years back: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/animaker-2

We've hit 2.3 million users ever since and the ride has been nothing short of an adventure. A lot of that credit goes to the Product Hunters who motivated us during our early days with their valuable feedback! :)

We believe in empowering people with DIY tools: With Animaker we are aiming to help everyone own their own in-house studio.  With Picmaker, the latest addition to our family of products, we want to help these video creators take their YouTube game to the next level.
Quick Story: 
Animaker support team‚Äôs practice of consistently engaging with the subscriber base revealed that some of our users who uploaded their videos to YouTube faced low CTR. This meant that their videos weren‚Äôt getting the visibility they deserved on YouTube. Our users were in desperate need of a way to solve this problem.

As we always do, we decided to help our users jump over this hurdle. When we did some extensive research on this topic, we found out that all of the top performing YouTube videos had one thing in common. A compelling video thumbnail!

While Animaker product team was contemplating the priority of this hurdle against a dozen others, we started noticing that some Animaker subscribers were taking screenshots of scenes from their Animaker videos and editing these screenshots a bit to create custom thumbnails. 

When we reached out to these users, they told us that they couldn‚Äôt find any other DIY solution that could help them with their thumbnail creation. None of the available solutions had important features like a Background burner tool or a sticker effect tool that are vital to making a good thumbnail. This was when we realized that it was time to move this insight up the ladder and get a solution ready for this user problem.
This sparked the creation of Picmaker.io.
We have equipped Picmaker with 100,000+ graphic elements, 700+ prebuilt templates, 1000+ stock photos, photo filters, and custom fonts so that you get a one-stop solution for all your YouTube thumbnail making needs.
We would love it if you tried it & gave us your feedback :D

The app supports a mission to ease human suffering with digital treatment technologies that help humanity triumph over trauma.

";3;-4;True;True;False;Long;Short;No;No;Harnessing neuroscience to disrupt patterns of stress;Long;No;Yes;No;Yes;1;No;No;No;139297;Howard Hunt;Yes;Yes;Low;Few;Yes;139297;Howard Hunt;Yes;Yes;Low;Yes;"Happy to share my new offering with our fellow hunters. HERE is a meditation app with game-like interaction modules that blend breathing, staring and swiping components, to quickly interrupt stress patterns.

The science is pretty simple.
| SWIPING ‚Äì improves executive function by stimulating both hemispheres of the brain‚Ä®
| STARING ‚Äì promotes a daydream state, and the unconscious connecting of dots
‚Ä®| BREATHING ‚Äì instills a deep state of relaxation (.. not exactly revolutionary)

Because interaction provides focus for a wandering mind, this is a great tool for people who struggle to sit still, or quietly for extended periods. It also helps people all along the stress spectrum including those triggered by trauma. (Side note: we ran a 3 month pilot that revealed double digit improvements in measures of stress, anxiety and depression on the pre/during/post DASS scale.)

Call it a peace hack. Call it meditation light. The reality is, it really works. If you only have a few minutes between meetings, during transit, or before bed, you can fire up a short session and in as little as 3 minutes, feel a sense of peace and recalibration. Plus you can choose to use an interaction module to dial yourself in briefly, and then settle back into an extended meditation session. That‚Äôs one of the benefits of HERE, it‚Äôs versatile and gives you plenty of scope to customize your session. A small range of audio is on offer; from idyllic instrumentals, to beat driven music, and guided conversations with your higher self (hands up if you like you a side of woo-woo with your science). 

We‚Äôre shooting for the intersection of science, soul and technology and have released the app FREE on iOS and Android. HERE GLOBAL FOUNDATION is a nonprofit that will modify this app for specific communities on the frontlines of trauma, where mental health services under-resourced, including refugees, victims of violence, veterans and other mental health advocacy groups.

Obviously this is an MVP so there are LOADS of ways it can be improved over time. And knowing how crowded the meditation space is, I‚Äôm sure our hunter community will have kind-hearted yet crucial feedback on this meditation twist. Frankly I‚Äôm just glad I didn‚Äôt hunt my app on the same day my hero @samharrisofficial dropped his :)

So there you have it hunterinos

I'm Kamil Powa≈Çowski and I've made small macOS that allows you to create countdowns and time progress indicators and have easy access to them from menu/status bar.
I've been using this app myself for a while, but now I've decided to make it public.

You can download it for free from the Mac App Store. For free you can create one countdown/progress item and decide to display it on the menu bar or not. If you want to have more countdowns, it will require a ‚Äãyearly 2$ subscription.

I hope you will enjoy this app as I do during writing and using it.
@jonasalmut Thank you. I'm using this myself for tracking important deadlines (end of development sprint etc) but I could come up with more ideas of using Countdowns. Some people suggested that it can be used for tracking short time deadlines (like the end of a workday, or time to call with a client). For now, adding that quick countdowns may be hard (you have to go to Preferences), but I'm thinking about an option to add events quicker.";3;-1;True;False;False;web development

Tristan, thanks for hunting us. 

We haven‚Äôt been here since featuring our email time optimizer on Product Hunt (which turned out to be quite a hit, so thanks for the support!). 

Today we‚Äôre coming back with something BIG. Ladies and gentlemen, let us proudly present (an upgraded version of) Growbots  - a sales platform to give your team an efficiency boost. It automates non-value-adding activities like prospecting and email outreach to let your sales team focus on revenue generation. 

We‚Äôve received tons of feedback from our customers, and for a year we worked tirelessly on making the app better. Actually, we‚Äôve completely redesigned it. Now Growbots revolves around processes rather than features, which makes it much more intuitive. Goodbye chaos, hello clarity!  

All processes are easy to follow. Initially the user chooses their target audience (based on very specific targeting criteria). Then they decide on their email content, select email channels to send their messages from, and eventually personalize each message and send it to their prospects. The entire outbound sales process is streamlined and fully automated.  

Here‚Äôs what you can do with Growbots!

1. Automate prospecting to spend more time on revenue generating activities:
 - At Growbots you‚Äôll not only get a tailored prospect list instantly, but you‚Äôll be able to verify all prospects within minutes. Easily accept/ reject contacts which are/aren‚Äôt in your target. Prospecting doesn‚Äôt get any simpler than this. 

2. Reach your prospects with the right messaging at the right time: 
- Use detailed prospect information available at Growbots to fully personalize your emails. All your emails will be scheduled automatically based on your prospect‚Äôs timezone. 

3. Have control over your outbound sales process: 
- Get full scheduling visibility, know exactly when your emails will go out.  Our special algorithm will ensure you don‚Äôt exceed email sending limits, to keep your domain reputation untouched 
- Send your campaigns from multiple email channels and manage all of them from a single account.

4. Use data to make smart business decisions and optimize your results:
- Get a live estimate of your market size based on your targeting criteria. 
- A/B test various elements of your campaign including: email templates (which you can then reuse in different sequences). This makes creating new email sequences super quick, and speeds up the execution of your future outbound campaigns. 

5. Seamlessly integrate Growbots with your CRM:
- Growbots has a native integration with Salesforce and Hubspot. We‚Äôll handle data deduplication and keep all your contacts fresh and up to date. 
- Zapier integration is coming very soon!  

Without further ado‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs Growbots. Go check it out, and let us know what you think. We can‚Äôt wait to hear your feedback! 

Ah‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve nearly forgotten to mention that we have a special deal for you hunters! Get 50% or even 100% more prospects (depending on your package) at no extra cost.
@lanre__akin Thanks, yes, Zapier integration is already in internal beta :) Currently you can integrate with CRM's like Pipedrive, Zoho, Sugar, etc. using .CSV files!
@mattellsworth thanks Matt :)
@itaielizur Thanks Itai! We will first focus on lead enrichment and scoring!

I'm Izzy, the founder of Unlock China.

About a year ago, I became fascinated with the tech industry in China. I began to learn more and more about some of the incredible tech and innovation coming out of the country and decided it was time to pull the trigger and immerse myself into the Chinese tech ecosystem for an extended period of time.

After speaking to a number of people, it became clear to me that I wasn't the only one interested in the Chinese tech ecosystem.

That's when I decided to curate a trip to bring a group of people along for the ride. 

Over the last 5 months, I've connected with an incredible community of makers, startup incubators, manufacturing plants, tech companies, coworking spaces and much more in China, and have put together a trip tech nerds will drool over. 



??WHY CHINA?
Here are a few things about China you may or may not know. And if you don't, all the more reason to start taking China way more seriously than you have, and consider joining us.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Cashless Society
Did you know that China is way beyond us in payment tech? Today in China, WeChat has over 900 million daily active users, 89% of which use WeChat Pay to pay for anything and everything from groceries, to subway rides, to giving money to homeless people (no, I'm not kidding).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Startups and Venture Capital
Chinese startups have raised over 3X as much as U.S. startups on average per Series A deal in the last 5 years. China is also the only country in the world that has had billion-dollar Series-A rounds of investment. China accounts for 38.9 per cent of the total number of unicorns globally, and the US accounts for 42.1 per cent.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Technological Advancement
Hyped about Amazon Go, the world's first cashierless grocery store? Well get this. In 2016, Bingo Box, a Chinese startup, launched a chain of cashierless convenience stores. Today they operate 200 stores in 29 different Chinese cities. Sorry Amazon! 

4Ô∏è‚É£ National Infrastructure
China is building infrastructure faster than any other country in the world. Don‚Äôt believe it? Take a look at the country‚Äôs ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which aims to connect 70 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and Oceania by shipping route or railroad. Not enough? Then take a look at how China just unveiled the world‚Äôs longest sea-crossing bridge, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge spanning 55km. The country‚Äôs raw production power is unparalleled.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Clean Tech
68 of the world‚Äôs largest 200 publicly-listed clean tech firms are China-based. Twice the number of the 35 from the US, despite the US stock market being more than twice the size of Greater China‚Äôs.


? MY GOALS 
Business China is extremely relationship-driven. My aim for this trip is to differentiate us from regular tourists by creating an environment of true immersion and integration. We'll be working out of a Chinese co-working space, attending tech events in the ecosystem, taking weekly mandarin lessons to gain cultural and language fluency, and much more. 

Don‚Äôt just visit China as a tourist, fully integrate yourself into Chinese culture through authentic experiences and day-to-day life. Let us take all the hassle out of building your network, expanding business and learning about manufacturing in China.


??WHY ME?
I spent over a year organizing international co-working retreats, building pop-up coworking spaces, and organizing international tech meetups with Hacker Paradise, which pioneered the digital nomad retreat. Over the last two years I've organized over 100 events as the Community Manager for Lighthouse Labs, Canada's largest coding bootcamp. 

Today, I'm an active member in the Toronto tech community, and experienced with groups, community-building, international travel, and to top it off have taught myself mandarin (which I hope to perfect over the course of this trip).

I hope you enjoy! Please ask any questions, make suggestions! Whatever floats your boat! Thank you!";4;-3;True;True;False;creativity

Latasha Kennedy here. I'm a screenwriter and filmmaker. I'm also the Co-Founder of Location Locked, a new peer sharing marketplace that offers content creators and filmmakers an opportunity to book spaces for their projects without busting their budget. It also provides an opportunity for creatives and art enthusiasts to make passive income.

Here's how the whole thing started: when we were scouting for my short film, One Last Goodbye, in April many people said just check Airbnb or Peerspace. 

We did and in doing that, we found out a few things:

1. Not everyone on Airbnb is interested in offering their space for film productions.

2. If they are willing to rent their space out to you, often times they want to move it off of Airbnb, which comes with a hefty price increase.  I'd say moving the cost from $250/day to $1000/day is pretty steep, wouldn't you?

3. Peerspace has lovely spaces to book but they're pretty costly most of the time.

We knew we weren't the only ones that were facing financial challenges when trying to shoot projects. To be sure, we surveyed many of our peers and many of them agreed: the affordability of preferred locations is often one of the most challenging aspects of creating content. That sucks.

Our solution?

LOCATION LOCKED: where peers and those who love the arts give artists a hand-up to ensure that another fellow filmmaker can get their project done.

One day, the penny dropped. I didn‚Äôt want to look like I lived in my mother‚Äôs basement anymore. But I still wanted to identify as a web dev. Just a really really cool one.

Unfortunately, those same tired designs like ‚ÄúKeep Calm and Stackoverflow‚Äù weren‚Äôt going to cut it. 

And that‚Äôs how Devnull Clothing was born - a label created by a web dev for web devs like you with only the slickest designs. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to release the programista in you before the weekend. 

At Devnull Clothing, we believe in giving back. Which is why we will donate 10% of our profits to the Save the Children charity.

Together, we can make a change, thread by thread ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Lastly, use the promo code ""PRODUCTHUNT"" at the checkout to get 10% off! The promotion ends on 7th of October 2018.

@aalpanigrahi Thanks for the input Aashish. That's a great point that I hadn't really thought about before. You're right, in that this might not work for all decisions, especially if a choice is missing that someone can't really see. Perhaps I've framed it too broadly or perhaps it's better suited paired with some exploratory step beforehand. Ideally, this would help distinguish between a list of preknown choices, interconnected or not, by way of scoring based purely on return value of each. They can have the same pros and cons, or the same affect, but so long as there some are different, one should come out on top. If not, the app displays the results as a tie, which means you can go back and reassess how you got there, or decide there is no better choice. If I don't fully understand what you mean by interconnected decisions, please feel free to elaborate.

Still though, it's not perfect, and I'd like to find ways to improve it. Currently I think there could be some more fidelity to ranking eash pro/con and also might be better to score on a curve or give the option to pick a curve to score on. Still exploring ideas that'll keep it simple and useful.
@aalpanigrahi Ahhh, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. There really isn't any mechanism to account for odds like that.

I think as it stands, I would structure it as a choice between B & C with the ""Chance at A"" being a Full Pro ? of B, but counterbalance it with ""High Risk of Failure"" as a Full Con ? of B.

Think this approach would still work for your VC vs Stock voting power as well, though it could end up as a tie, depending on how you value the pros & cons of each. In the general case, your company dying seems like the biggest Con, bigger than losing voting power, so I would end up rating accordingly.

Still though, it's not very elegant or straightforward and I see your point quite clearly now. I'll have to think of some way to narrow the scope of types of decisions this is best for, or widen it to better support interconnected choices like you've mentioned.

Really appreciate the feedback and detailed explanation. Honestly I hadn't thought that deeply about it because I've always been able to structure my choices in this way. But to your point, I would often imbibe my Pros and Cons with risk directly in the titles.

Works for now, but would be nicer if there was a dedicated mechanism to account for that!

For the last few months, I've been building something cool. 
Unicorn Platform is a static landing page generator for startups. Let's see what is special about it.


<b>About</b>
A landing page is not just a bunch of text 'n' pics to throw to your customers. And it is more than a marketing tool.

Your landing page is <i>the face</i> of your startup. Your audience subconsciously perceives the team, the product, the investor's board, the founders by looking at your LP. 

That is why one should not just throw some blocks from a free HTML template and get just fine LP. A website is an important thing, not just a checkbox in your todo list.

If your website offers more: it's friendly, entertaining, engaging, intriguing - you get much more loyal and interested clients. Your business grows faster ?

Making a creative LP is a hard task. Unicorn Platform is aimed to help you create a humanized website.


<b>Product</b>
Currently, Unicorn Platform is a static landing page generator. It produces HTML templates. After exporting your should edit content in a text editor such as SublimeText.
This is just the very first iteration (see <a href=""https://www.notion.so/Product-Changelog-568b4245b18542dd95a95370c0623ba9"" target=""_blank"">changelog</a>). Unicorn Platform will grow into a mature horsie and will get it's own online editor, hosting and many more innovative features.

Here are some websites made with Unicorn Platform:
- <a href=""https://klipped.in"">Klipped.in</a> - minimalistic text sharing tool by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/0xferruccio"">Ferruccio</a> is the first real user of Unicorn Platform.
- <a href=""https://unicornplatform.com/examples/notion"" target=""_blank"">Notion</a> - notes, tasks, wikis, tables - all in one place. Since I love Notion a lot I've decided to create an example of what Notion LP would look like if their landing has been made with Unicorn Platform. (Lillie from Notion gladly allowed me to do that).


<b>Pricing</b>
Pro subscription costs $80 per year (beta price). It will unlock all Pro components and templates.
Additionaly, for $180 you can purchase a <a href=""https://unicornplatform.com/blog/become-an-early-adopter/"" target=""_blank"">life-time access</a> to Unicorn Platform website builder - including all future versions of the product.

- Need to implement live chat but don't know where to begin? You get the idea.

How Support List Came To Be ?

I got my start doing customer support for a SaaS company. Back then I signed up for every help desk product and went through countless live chat tools until I eventually found what worked best for our team. 

Today, I run <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/limitless-designs"">Limitless Designs</a>, an unlimited graphic design service that is powered by a remote team using a variety of tools to give our customers the best experience.

Support List is the byproduct of all those years spent experimenting and being curious about finding better ways to give great service.

This is the resource I wish I had when I was starting out, hopefully it helps you.

I built QuickNote mostly for fun and to learn the Serverless architecture.
However, I actually found myself using it more and more so I decided to open it to the public.

?
My main pain point was that of sharing quick notes with people online (like links, images, snippets of text) but not wanting to create a Google Doc or EverNote note and change the sharing settings.

?
In short, QuickNote allows anybody to create a quick note and share it online.
No signup, no payment, no sharing configurations. Nothing.
Just go to https://quicknote.io, create your note (add images, videos, bullet points, etc) and share it with the world in a few seconds.

?
Here are some examples:
* Code sharing: https://quicknote.io/56d8a010-c2fa-11e8-8b1e-dd72d0895237
* With image: https://quicknote.io/f1e02010-c2fa-11e8-8b1e-dd72d0895237
* Simple text with links: https://quicknote.io/55e80910-c2fb-11e8-8b1e-dd72d0895237

PS: Shout out to the fine people at WIP who made me change my mind about using the original name ""OneNote""!

Enjoy ? and let me know if you have any question or feedback!

We launched the Fanalyze App to quickly analyze fantasy fantasy football data on your iPhone and Android phone. We developed a few web apps and learned the fastest way to get to data is by using Search. We used the same concept to compare players. You can search two or more players to get a side-by-side comparison. Our goal is to make it easier and faster to save users time with their research/analysis. We plan to add other top professional sports data in the near future.

Key Features

Search NFL player and get:
- Profile, average stats and news
- Opponent info, odds, season schedule
- Player related tweets
- Season stats with graphs

Search 2+ player and get:
- Side by side comparison
- Weekly graphs to view trends
- Projections, opponent defense ranking, daily fantasy player values
- Season stats

You can tryout our Fanalyze App without a login by searching a NFL player or players to compare. We appreciate your feedback and look forward to answering any questions you may have.";2;-2;True;True;False;community

No easy way exists for students to gain valuable experience in their industry and insight into what is needed for them to be ready for their career filed, before they finish their studies.

Students are coming out of university with a lack of experience that is halting them from getting the career opportunities that they want.

So we built a platform that provides students the resources to prepare for their desired career and expose them to using freelance opportunities to gain experience quickly.

The first 5 months of our beta launch,¬†the platform had provided over 20 students more than ¬£3,000 worth of paid work experience. Something they were not able to do before TiTo, and over 100 students with portfolios ready to get them work in the industry.

Recently I started the ""12 startups in 12 months"" challenge to get myself back into the groove of shipping products again (after years in a corporate job). This is startup #1.

I sell some digital download products and have been frustrated at the lack of options out there. The two choices seemed to be either a bloated wordpress install with multiple plugins, or an online marketplace that takes commissions from my sales.

So I created an alternative! Zipsell is a super simple digital downloads e-commerce platform written in Ruby on Rails. It's free and open source. You host it yourself and all payments go directly to your stripe account!

It's such a great feeling to get a product shipped for the first time in years - I'm pretty much shaking as I type this!

I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have ?
@kay_tan Thanks for the support!
@allbombs The target audience is people who need to sell digital downloads but don't want to do it on wordpress or a 3rd party marketplace. I feel like that's a growing segment. At the moment this might mean it's geared more towards technical folks but I'm sure there's improvements I can implement to make the setup easy for anyone.
@allbombs For now I think the main value proposition is helping you maximise your profit. For example, one of the leading 3rd party marketplaces charges an 8.5% fee on every one of your sales. If you're selling low cost products that might not bother you, but if you're selling a $299 product and paying $25 to the marketplace for each transaction - you'd be looking for long-term alternatives. The best route is to self-host but there aren't many drop-dead simple solutions out there. This is me throwing my hat into the ring ?
@woodss I think it's a fair question.

I can answer in three ways.

1) Partly this is a question of semantics. It does depend on what definition of a startup you subscribe to. Do all startups make money from day one? Certainly not. Should I, as a bootstrapped founder be more focused on revenue generation from day one? Erm.. yes, probably ? however, as I mentioned in the article linked to this submission, this first ""startup"" is me exercising my product skillset again after a long hiatus. I wasn't super focused on revenue for this first launch, but revenue will definitely be a consideration for the next 11.

2) Allegorical example - when Wordpress launched did anyone consider it a startup? I don't think so. But somewhere along the line it morphed from ""project"" to ""multi million dollar ecosystem"". The same can be said for all commercially successful open source projects - they all started with a cruddy v1 that some people found useful. Not that I have ambitions as lofty as these, but it's something to remember before thinking there's nothing to be gained from developing free tools.

3) Practical example - I'm planning to use Zipsell to sell my own digital downloads, so you can sort of see it as a ""foundational"" piece of work for a startup...

Hope that makes sense!
@captmacsparrow that‚Äôs awesome! So glad to hear it :) let me know how you get on and if you have any feedback

Last Tuesday a total of 5 startup acquisitions happened. After reading some of these ""exciting, we have been acquired"" letters, I thought I could help the next acquired founders. So yesterday I spent about two hours hacking this together. A little something to make a bit of fun of those all too common letters from founders after they have been acquired. ?

Here is <a href='https://www.wehavebeenacquired.com/startup-costs'>one I made for Startup Costs</a> where I tell how excited I am to be acquired by Stripe. ?

Love to see by who you get acquired! Let me know if you like me to add anything (more emoji maybe?)?

Some other newly added ones:

- Chatfuel is acquired by Facebook ? - https://www.wehavebeenacquired.com/chatfuel
- Dofo is acquired by Godaddy ? - https://www.wehavebeenacquired.com/dofo

I created Peerdium. Peerdium is a censorship-resistant publishing platform. Let me explain how Peerdium works. When you create a new post the content is encrypted and stored in your browser cache. The browser would then create a torrent and starts seeding the encrypted post. The URL of the post contains the magnet URI (identifier) of the torrent file as well as the key to decrypt the content. When you share the URL with your friends the browser will fetch the torrent with the help of the magnet URI. It is then decrypted using the key present in the URL. The more people
have a tab opened of the post the harder it is to take down. If you like a post you can heart the post to save it in your browser cache.

Peerdium is open source. Checkout https://github.com/hackerkid/peerdium

You should check out this video

> If using WebRTC you still need a server for building up the connection don‚Äôt you?

Yesh. But it is not dependent on a single server. Webtorrent takes as input a bunch of tracking servers. There are a lot of tracking servers out there on the internet. If one goes down there would be more coming up :)

About a month ago I was talking to some fellow-makers about their monthly running costs. How much was it? What products do they use? Being fairly open about some metrics of my business, I was surprised to see many do not share their monthly running costs. I do find it's an interesting metric, after all: running a modern internet company often relies on other online companies. Also: how much is left after paying most bills? After getting some positive feedback from others, I decided to spend part of my weekend getting something decent out the door. ?

The feedback after I shared this basic version on various places was really positive. Makers and founders alike were excited to browse through the listings and to sshare their monthly running costs too: ‚ÄúI enjoy using it to keep track of the various services I use‚Äù and ‚ÄúI discovered product X through Startup Costs‚Äù. ?

Since that first version, the feature-set has mostly stayed the same. The biggest addition since is the ‚Äúproduct directory‚Äù. This is a categorised overview of products currently in use by startups and is ordered by popularity. It's built MVP-style, so expect more features to be added. ?

I keep a simple roadmap on the site. New features include one-time costs, different intervals (quarterly, annual) and more. These and others will be part of the ‚Äúpro features‚Äù I am working on. 

Monthly running costs featured in the images are from <a href='https://www.startupcosts.co/muna'>Muna</a>, <a href='https://www.startupcosts.co/blurt'>Blurt</a> by @corey_gwin and <a href='https://www.startupcosts.co/krit'>Krit</a> by @AndrewAskins.

Thanks to all founders, makers and others already added their running costs. It's been inspiring and refreshing to see. ‚ô•Ô∏è?

If you have any questions or ideas, let me know. Any maker that's on Product Hunt you want to see on Startup Costs? Tag them in the comments! ?
And if you are brave, you can <a href='https://www.startupcosts.co/add'>add your monthly running costs</a> too. ‚úåÔ∏è

After several months of development, I'm really excited to share my first product with the PH community!

While there are a variety of applications for sharing screenshots, most of them are forcing you to use their own cloud systems, which are not always reliable and secure. That's why I built ScreenTray which is focused on better integration with existing cloud providers like Google Drive and Dropbox. 

ScreenTray allows you to choose who to share your uploaded screenshots with. You can use a public folder for sharing with everyone who has a link or private folders for sharing  only with your team. 

There are also a few more goodies like a simple interface designed for quick annotations, ability to copy directly to the clipboard, ability to watermark screenshots with the logo of your company.

The app is completely free if you don't mind a small ScreenTray logo on all screenshots. If you want to remove the logo or replace it with your own logo, you will need to buy a license.

To celebrate the release, I've prepared some special discount coupons for you guys:
lovePH30 ‚Äì 30% off (‚àû allowed uses)
lovePH50 ‚Äì 50% off (50 allowed uses)
Don't hesitate because they will expire in one week ? 

Let me know what you think about the app please. I will appreciate any feedback. Thanks!
@ani_hakobyan Thanks Annie!
@francoolaami Hi Francoo! Thank you for the honest feedback!
Actually, ScreenTray takes only 70-90 megabytes of RAM and it's not that much if you look at the competitors. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tnF_cGVukej8NoZ2rxCxD9HMwy5jFfH1/view
It also allocates additional resources for each window, but they are immediately dellocated as soon as you close the window.

As for onpaste.com, compare 
1) take screenshot => 2) open a new tab => 3) paste screenshot => 4) annotate => 5) upload => 6) copy a link => 7) paste the link
to
1) take screenshot => 2) annotate => 3) upload => 4) paste the link

Anyway, I'm looking forward to your feedback in 3-4 days! Thanks!
@tcodinat Hi Toni! Thanks for your feedback ? 
As I said in my maker comment, the biggest advantages of Google Drive / Dropbox are reliability and security. For example, I once developed a simple web scraper and was able to download lots of screenshots from a popular service which provides free storage for screenshots. People often don't understand that those screenshots are public and capture sensitive information like paychecks, license keys, passwords and so on. By the way, that was just an experiment, I didn't hurt anyone ?
Also, screenshots don't take that much space, and I personally prefer to keep all my stuff in one place (Google Drive).
Hi @goldy_arora! Thanks for the feedback!
It's really hard to compete with lifetime deals, but I think that CloudApp is overwhelmed with features a little bit. ScreenTray provides a much simpler interface. 
Other than that, it's just a matter of preference. Some people might prefer Google Drive / Dropbox over the CloudApp cloud.
@owenfar1 Hi Owen! That's a great question.
While the native screen capture tool got definitely better in the macOS Mojave release, it's still missing some features that ScreenTray provides:
1. Simpler interface designed specifically for quick annotations. Just check out the combined arrow + text and rectangle + text tools. You will need more steps in the native macOS editor to achieve that. By the way, it is also missing the blur tool.
2. Advanced cloud integration.
3. Ability to add your own logo to screenshots.

I am here to answer any questions ? 

I threw WritKit together after discovering that it takes the average blogger 3 hours and 20 minutes to write a blog (that industry average is on the rise year over year). Recently I have been contemplating and researching ways I can drastically lower the time to post for bloggers (TTP - how long it takes to go from Idea stage to Publish stage).

From AI-writing blog software to Alexa-style conversational blog creation, I've arrived at the conclusion that breaking the blogging process down into individual steps then optimizing each one is the current best approach to helping bloggers do more with their limited hours. I threw together WritKit with this mindset (no links are affiliate) and hope to learn a lot more about blog writing as a result.

Please feel free to ask me any questions, to submit new tool recommendations if you feel so inclined, and, above all, please enjoy this resource!

This weekend I had enough of that and my project became to create a simple API for it...

You give us a URL and we return any contact data we can find (eg. email, phone), social data (eg. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) as well as review sites in use (eg. Yelp, Tripadvisor and 50+ others).

Here are a few use cases that come to mind:

- Sales... easily get emails/phone numbers for your outreach
- Find review profiles for a given company and feed them to the Review Scraper API [0] to get their reviews
- Use review data in your next email outreach campaign to customize your email, eg. ""Hey X, Congrats on your 5-star review from Jason last week!"" - this works wonders ?
- Follow or monitor companies on their social profiles

There are already tools that return known email addresses for a given domain, but they don't actually go to the website to fetch that data. The number of times such tools have come up empty handed and I've found the email directly on the target website is staggering. This API also returns a lot more data than just email addresses. We've started using this internally and it's already made our life so much easier, and I hope it will for you too!

This is just the start - there is so much more we can achieve and I would love to hear from the community how you would use this? Feel free to sign up to the free tier and go wild :)

@thiagoafram glad to hear that, we could create a zapier app if there was enough demand ?
@jwelch thanks for checking us out! when it comes to review data, we released our review scraper api [0] a few weeks ago and got to learn about a bunch of uses cases around scraping reviews. the process with that api looks like this:

1) find the review profile url (eg. yelp) for a given company
2) pass it to the review scraper api
3) receive reviews back

this metadata api let's us automate step #1, so eg. if you want to get reviews for your competitor, just give us their website URL and then we can get their reviews.

as for collecting review data, we picked up clients in very different industries since we launched that api a few weeks ago. the overarching theme is generating actionable insights based on review data - whether on industry, company or competitors. we do this ourselves @ Reviewshake but thought it'd be cool to open up our infrastructure to help other companies too.

hope this makes sense?

hey @_christine !

We've been around for about a year and a half and service roughly half a million members, so we're a bit smaller I believe.

1. We have more deal personalization (we send members specific dates for our deals relevant to their departure city which links them out to book, rather than sending them to a random Google Flights link),
2. Instant text alerts for Premium Members so they get deals faster
3. We don't have as large of a Free User base so spend more time providing a better Premium Service with more deals for Premium Members. 
4. We service more departure countries, so our market is wider.

I'm Steph and I'm new to the maker scene, but I'm so excited to be here. 

?After nomading for 2+ years, I wanted a tool that organized <b>all</b> digital nomad retreats in a simple way, that inspired others to try them and start working remotely. The problem was.... I had no clue how to code.  So, back in February, I set out on a very rocky mission to learn full-stack development, which I've very candidly tracked <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RdHXh6n1WkB6junPdseT_Ec4AEM1WQych3i6byMZBFo/edit?usp=sharing"">here</a>. 

?9 months and many excuses later, I finally focused in August and built my vision of a ""hubb"" for both <i>promads</i> and <i>noobmads</i>, where they can happily explore trips, draw inspiration, and get a glimpse into how this space is growing! 

?I specifically wanted a tool that aligned with how people tend to make decisions when choosing a retreat: location, timing, and length.

- Have a month of unplanned travels open? Sort by <a href =""https://www.nomadhubb.com/retreats"">date</a>.
- Always wanted to go to India? Dying to see Africa? Search by <a href=""https://www.nomadhubb.com/locations"">location</a> or <a href=""https://www.nomadhubb.com/locations#locations"">continent</a>.
- Planning on really taking the plunge? Check out <a href=""https://www.nomadhubb.com/extended"">3+ month options</a> like Remote Year.
- Taking your business to the next level? Find <a href=""https://www.nomadhubb.com/trips#specialized"">specialized trips</a> like coding bootcamps or trips that give back.
- Looking for flexible options? These businesses offer <a href=""https://www.nomadhubb.com/stationary"">coliving on-demand</a>.
- Hoping to meet hundreds of other nomads? Check out remote-focused <a href=""https://www.nomadhubb.com/events"">events</a>.

?‚Äç?So, here is nomad(hubb)! Through this project, I‚Äôve developed a love for coding and a deeper appreciation for the nomad community. Also, big thank you to @marie_dm_ for setting up the Women Make community. 

?Let me know what you think, including retreats or features you'd add! I'd love to hear feedback from everyone.

@kucukkanat Hey Eek! Our main target audience is companies / co-working spaces (ie more banks of desks than individual desks -- and that's where my background & experience lies) - and in that area we're pretty competitive / verging on cheap compared to competing desk systems. 

I'm told even for single desks our pricing is competitive, but I guess that's very relative -- it's certainly probably more than Ikea, but less than most designer desks ?

But we're also looking at mitigating it by adding the option of wider slats of wood [ie 60cm+ wide] in the area[s] where one would mostly use paper/mice. We're also looking at potentially some form of blotter pad.

Thanks for the question, @nickchuckwalter.  We have a 2 part approach: first and foremost we work directly with advertisers and media agencies who purchase the inventory and secondly, we sell programmatically with real time bidding. At the moment we are concentrating on:
A. Ensuring that the tech is stable for when we scale.
B. Scaling the user base (so that we can attract more advertising partners) 
C. Growing our sales team in order to bring more advertisers on board (and create more ad revenue for users)

Part of the reason AI is so important here is that it helps us figure out how to translate what humans say into a positive change in the recipe. For example, early on, everyone said they wanted a higher ABV in the recipe, but the algorithms learnt that that resulted in a beer people liked less - the algorithms made a mistake, then learnt not to make the same mistake again.

I totally agree on variety - we're not trying to make a single beer, rather we want to make a large variety that is constantly iterating. This means we want people to constantly be trying new beer types with us. Our job is just to make sure the experimentation (from both the brewer and the consumer side) is the best it can be.
@chris_crompton1 Hey Chris. Great question. To be clear, in theory we can use the technology to optimise a single mass market beer for everyone, or a whole range of different beers, potentially even one for each customer. 

Now, it‚Äôs obviously more expensive to make individual beers than it is large volume batches. In actual fact, our supply chain (I.e., the breweries we work with) puts a constraint on the number of different products we can make at any time. Our core approach is to optimise product clusters and supply chain at the same time (constrained optimisation) - if we discover a new product needs to be made, then we expand our supply chain!

This approach can pretty much be applied to all consumer products, even services as well. The problem we‚Äôre solving is universal, hence we believe this is infinitely scalable.
@tostartafire Hey Dan, check out my answer to Chris above.

Although you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not viable to make a single beer for everyone yet - as we expand our supply chain and manufacturing becomes more efficient, the possibility is there to do just that.";3;-3;True;True;False;creativity

Hi PH-ers ?,
Really exciting to be on Product Hunt. Let me explain a bit more why I started Landista.

I'm currently running a few online businesses and I have some experience with selling and buying my online business through brokers. Those brokers can do great work for you, both for you as seller and for you as buyer. But I missed the overview of all online businesses that are for sale from all the different brokers. That's where Landista cames up ? 

- Landista is scanning all sites from premium brokers for new or changed listings for sale.
- We only list online businesses, like SaaS, eCommerce, etc.
- I decided to only list the 'premium' brokers, to prevent the site from being filled with lots of 'wannabe businesses'...
- You can sign up for the email service, so you get a weekly email with all the latest businesses for sale
- Disclaimer: I don't have any relation with those brokers 

Hopefully this can be of interest for you. Maybe once your PH-product will be listed to be sold for ?
@tcodinat Cool!
If you fill out the form 'Sell your business' on Landista we will match you with the right broker to achieve this. Good luck ?

I'm Augie. used to be a full time YouTuber and over the course of doing so amassed roughly 20 million views and 200,000+ subscribers in the basketball niche. Editing was always a pain point for me as I was required to meet a strict upload schedule for my audience and wanted everything to look perfect. I wanted something to make the process easier and struggled to find any paid editors who met a level of quality I was happy uploading to my channel.

This frustration sprouted the idea for Vidchops. It's a service which provides unlimited video editing for a small monthly fee. You provide the footage and requests while we edit it together into a professional looking video. Turnaround time is 48 hours or less and if you're not happy with the edit we'll revise it until you are.

The goal is to provide something creators can use which allows them to spend more time in front of the camera rather than behind a computer screen.

I'd love any constructive feedback and hope people find it useful. If you're wanting to sign up I have a 7 day free trial you can redeem by clicking here or visiting www.vidchops.com/special

It all started in some years ago. I guess it may be interesting to hear about where the idea came from. I knew a girl who was literally obsessed with being in fresh air (believe me, winters here in Estonia can be very cold) - even in the deep winter -28C she opened and kept the window open for a long time. So there I was sitting on the couch, ready to share some warm feelings, but it was very difficult to keep it going. I started to think if there would be a device that will tell us about the air quality and when to open the window/turn on the ventilation or do something else to improve.

To find a solution and execute the idea I needed the expertise in the design, technology, marketing - and that is how our team was formed.  
It took us 1 year to have the first prototype ready and then 2 more years to finetune it to great device and app which can give us not only information about our indoor environment but also tips and recommendations how to improve. Today the device is ready to rock! 

theO uses the most up-to-date technology and electronics available (It has VOC, PM, Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Light, Sound sensor). It has a WiFi interface which enables us to continue to make the device better day by day and send all the updates over the Wifi.

We‚Äôre excited to show off bidboard to the PH community and hear feedback. 

What my cofounder and I have created is a digital billboard to promote your startup, service or share offers to fellow product enthusiasts. A new bid starts over every day and the billboard goes to the top 3 bidders the following day for the next 24 hours.

Ozgur and myself both love to discover new products. So a product like Bidboard just felt natural to make. We started making it just for fun and entertainment. What it has become is a public billboard where any can share their product or other creative things. 

I‚Äôm more excited to see how people will react and use the product. Whether it‚Äôs for fun, business or other creative things like wishing someone a happy birthday or maybe a wedding proposal ?

Some FAQ:

How will you bring people to the site? 

We hope others interested in product discovery check bidboard out daily. However that‚Äôs not our end goal. What we hope to do is find other ways that allow our advertisers to reach an outside audience as well ?

If I place a bid and get out bid do I get my money back? 

Yes, only the top 3 bidders get charged. Happy Bidding!!! 

Why did my ad get rejected?

They are a few reasons your bid may get rejected. 1. It contains a website link that links to a malicious or dangerous site. 2. The image and website contains nudity, racism or terrorism. 3. The image used to direct a link is misleading. 4. The bid payment was declined. 




@ryangilbert Great question, this is something we thought about when we first started building bidboard. Our hopes is that we start by keeping product enthusiasts interested by allowing advertisers to offer incentives or discounts for their services. However our end goal is to find ways that are advertisers can reach an outside audience. 
@mickc79 this is very interesting to see. A lot of this is set to incentivize you to want to be the top bidder. Specially since the first place bid has a longer show time than ?and? ";3;-4;True;True;False;web development

Interesting question, over the years I have read every blog out there on domaining and was pretty active in the domaining forums.  I've also by this point developed many premium domains, some of which grew with nothing other than the name it's self and word of mouth, while others required SEO, Gurrilla marketing, etc.

So I suppose you could say there is a some what gut feeling, but even then, I still go and do research to see if there is potential or if it's just a brandable domain.  The brandable I go more with my gut, although even those have certain things that make them far more valuable than others.

This is Tim, founder at WunderMail. ?

We started WunderMail a year ago to create the most native and beautiful way to access your Gmail account on Windows 10. Therefore, we applied the design principles of Microsoft latest Fluent Design system as much as possible. Unlike other mail clients WunderMail is completely built on top of the Gmail API. This allows WunderMail to support unique functions of Gmail like labels and inbox categories. Over the last couple of months, we‚Äôve worked closely with our amazing group of beta testers to continuously refine and enhance the UX to the user needs to ensure that WunderMail is a joy to use. With today‚Äôs launch we are extremely exited to share with you the result.

I hope to hear your thoughts and feedback!
@icartic We try to implement all Gmail features which are available via the Gmail API. Gmail Add-ons and Chrome extensions can not be accessed this way. Therefore we can unfortunately not support them at the moment.
@lebaux Thanks for your feedback. We decide to give free users a fully featured version of the app. Therefore the free version is supported by ads. You are right that this could be better communicated by us. The premium subscription for 9.99$ a year has been created as some beta user wished to have a fully ad free experience.
@ayushpokh Thanks for your feedback. Keyboard shortcuts are already on our backlog. Regarding the subscriptions: We are aware that some user would prefer to have an one time fee instead of an subscription. So we are definitely considering to add an one-time IAP purchase as an alternative.
@ayush_chandra Thanks for your feedback. I am glad you like it. Following 2 features are already finished and will be release with the next update in a around 2 weeks:
1. Accent colors - You will be able change the accent color and set different accent colors for different accounts
2. Privacy options - You will be able to lock WunderMail by a passcode and/or Windows Hello
Furthermore we have features on our backlog like a dark mode, keyboard shortcuts, support for Windows Timeline to name a few.
Regarding your questions how WunderMail differentiate to other mail clients:
As it is completely build on top of the Gmail API it does has support for Gmail specific functions like labels and inbox categories. Also in contrast to Windows Mail it does get push notifications. This means you will be notified immediately about new mails and not at irregular syncing intervals. Moreover WunderMail use multiple sources to import an avatar for the mail senders to make it easy for you to find your mails at a glance. And last but not least it has an beautiful UI.
@ron_cohen Hello Ron, thanks for the great question. WunderMail works completely local. This means the access token will not be send to our server. Therefore we do not have access to your mails. Instead the app is downloading a copy of your mails directly from the Google server in a local database in the App folder. As soon you delete the app, the local database gets also deleted. The only data which is shared to us is anonymous usage data. Also when you add an account in WunderMail if you want opt in for the newsletter. In case you opt in your mailaddress and some metadata like your signup date is send to us. However, receiving the newsletter is optional.";4;-2;True;True;False;community

I am Shreyas, designer of Udugore.Social, a decentralized peer to peer crowdfunding platform for social gifting or donation.

What does decentralized crowdfunding platform mean? 
Unlike existing crowdfunding platforms Udugore.Social acts as an enabler for running crowdfunding campaigns in Donation model and does not control or charge for its service.
The community comes together to run, manage and monitor social campaigns.
It is completely free to create and run a crowdfunding campaign on Udugore.Social. 

Inspiration
Most of the existing crowdfunding platforms charge some percentage of money collected as part of the campaign for the services provided. Minimum of 5% and extends  13.5% or more based on services opted. This is done without any preset cap.
While trying to raise funds for friend's medical emergency, we found it is faster to transfer funds directly to his account using existing payment interfaces and the entire amount would be available for the person in need.
We leveraged the social media platform for communication. Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms acted as channels for spreading the message similar to word of mouth but with wider reach.
Udugore.Social uses social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google+ and UPI payment interfaces to run campaigns @Zero cost. 

Basic Foundation.
Raising funds from friends and family is comparatively easier as compared to complete strangers.  This is because of inherent trust.
Udugore.Social's intention is to extend this trust to larger social circle.

Thank you for offering us the opportunity to present our project more in depth.

The idea behind Heya was to provide a new of communicating through virtual objects placed in a real world environment. A user goes to a certain location and places a virtual object, here in essence an egg, and leaves a secret message inside ? Another user goes to that same location, opens the egg, sees what‚Äôs inside, smiles and leaves another message inside. In fact, every user who has been at the location and who has opened that egg are now connected through a chat. So far what can be placed inside an egg is a textual message or a photo, but we have plans to expand the list with short videos and collectibles ?

As you can imagine the use of Heya is still very much open ended. In fact, the whole idea should be more thought out as a social artsy experiment. However, some immediate use should come to mind such as organizing treasure hunts, fortune cookies, rewarding users who are at a given location with coupons or gift cards ?, leaving a real physical object to find at the location like in geocaching, surprise your friends ? and more ...

Our inspiration was of course Pok√©mon Go, although the preliminary idea was first sketched out on a napkin some time beforehand. Enjoy!

This is my first large-scale chatbot launch. I've dabbled in building chatbots on various platforms for a while now, but had never found an idea worth pursuing to completion.

I, like many, was interested in getting into the ecommerce game at one point and nearly fell prey to the ""gurus"" trying to sell me their $1,000+ courses at every turn. I decided I wanted to build a tool that would help people new to the ecommerce world learn the ropes without spending a crazy amount of money.

The Dropshipping Assistant chatbot:

‚úÖ Lets you follow product categories to send you updates on new trending products (finding winning products is one of the #1 problems for people new to ecommerce)
‚úÖ Has a curated library of case studies & guides on some of the most important ecommerce topics
‚úÖ Has a curated library of tools that will help with everything from optimizing your site to customer support
‚úÖ Sends you guides, tools & product suggestions based on your interactions with the bot

Hope some of you find this interesting or useful!";3;-2;True;True;False;creativity

Thanks Ben for hunting this. I really appreciate the Product Hunt community sharing this as my goal is to help all startups generate more traffic without pending money.

If you are wondering what's new there are a few things:

1. You can now see how easily it is to rank for a keyword organically. We have a formula that looks how long it takes sites to rank as well as how optimized each site is. We also look at the overall authority.

2. Similar to V1, we show traffic estimations. But in V2, we added a graph at the top to show traffic over time.

3. There are many more advanced settings. We added a filters button to allow you to control the results a bit more and filter out the results you don't want.

4. You can also see the top 100 sites that rank for any given keyword in any language as well as their social share count.
@yanivgoldenberg thanks. Now I just need to add more features. ;)
@martin_polak it's a formula that looks at how often the rankings for that keyword change (SERP results for the top 100) as well as how much overall authority as each site ranking in the top 100 has and how optimized each site is. It goes much more in-depth than just those 3 metrics, but that is a simplified version.
@mastertushar you're welcome.
@ivan_burban thanks. Hopefully helps you with your marketing efforts. Best of luck. ?
@biraj thank you!
@itaielizur we are looking to add this in 2019. Most likely late 2019.
@martin_polak we take into account both.
@7justinv thanks!
@marco_diversi now I have to just release more features so it moves up to number 1 ;)
@martin_polak we have a database of over 600 million keywords and 11 billion web pages that we crawl on a regular basis. Almost everything is pre-fetched.
@agnes_thompso it will help you improve your SEO for any type of site. You can also use the keyword research tool for Youtube.
@lisa_sicard thanks! We worked a long time on the speed. We still have a bit to go on that end.
@rebecca_fleenor I'm glad it has helped you achieve some top spots. I can't wait to add the content ideas report as well, so the tool can help you get tons of social shares.
@alexbeofficial thanks for the idea!
@martin_polak PD is directly from AdWords. That number comes from them. PD is part of our SD formula... not the majority of it, just a very very small portion.
@martin_polak that's a bug... hit refresh (or clear cache). SD shows 61 on my end. PD shows 1. But there is something off as it isn't showing any keywords. Thanks for pointing that out.
@francoolaami you can compare some of the SERPs by just searching manually in France. Some maybe a bit off as the results on your end could be personalized assuming you have a lot of history Google has been tracking.

Not sure at the moment. We‚Äôre giving our customers the best price at the moment as our manufacturers give us a break on our first order. We‚Äôll only find out what the new price is after the original order is placed. 
@rdlou 
The point of this was to combine everything into one wallet that was a little slimmer than your regular wallet. 

If the idea is to go for a minimal design then surely something that combines everything into one piece that‚Äôs smaller than your regular wallet is the way to go. 

Sometimes all you want to take care of is one piece and not a whole bunch of products that do mediocre jobs. 
@joecarter4 

At the moment it won‚Äôt be possible purely due to the fact we don‚Äôt have any available for you to buy. 

Feel free to jump in, its only a few short months 
@eddiewade it's made from Vegetable Tanned Leather, procured from Italy. 

It's the finest leather available that also darkens beautifully overtime. 
@braydensamuel as we said above, we can't be sure of the price, we only know from the manufacturer that it will go up after our first order as they are discounting the first order.
@masternihongo thank you, we had a feeling that the wallet was outdated for the modern traveller/photographer so we had to fix that

This is when I realized that I've been doing this for a long time, that is searching for free resources every time I design or start a new project. So, I knew a lot of people were facing the same problem just like me, so I built noShit to solve that problem.

noShit is a list of free design resources that you can use for both personal projects as well as commercial projects?. It includes Illustrations, font and Icons from some really awesome people who want to give stuff away for free. 

This list will be updated every day with handpicked design resources. If you know of any free design resources, tweet at me on twitter and I'll add them to the list (@harowitzblack).

People were renting kayaks and canoes and getting fitted for life jackets. It was a brilliant, sunny day and the air buzzed with excitement.

On the back wall, I noticed a framed print that read:

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell boats. We sell time on the water.‚Äù

Clever‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand true. People don‚Äôt desire products, they desire feelings that products give them.

Back at the rental shop, very few people care about hull design or reinforced resin paddles. They want to soak up a summer afternoon. Spend time with people they love.

Those two framed sentences stayed with me, and they reflect how I think about my company, JotForm:

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt provide online forms. We make organizations more productive.‚Äù

It sounds easy for me to say this today. But it has been surprisingly tough to uncover our version of ‚Äútime on the water‚Äù; our distinctive value.

After all, who cares about forms?  I started the company 12 years ago, and even I‚Äôm not passionate about forms. 

We operate in a crowded industry, where even Google is gunning for our market share.

And our competitors are always pushing to ‚Äúelevate‚Äù forms. They write edgy web copy about AI and conversations. Some even claim that forms are dead, while others try coining one fancy term after another.

That‚Äôs fine. They can focus on the cool factor.

But our customers just want to do business, and do it well. How do we know? 

Six months ago, our customers gave us a message that was hard to digest at first.

In a series of interviews with our customers from California to Hong Kong, our User Experience Research (UXR) team found an unusual pattern.

We used to think about forms as a way to collect responses & data, but we discovered that many customers were actually using our product to act on the data‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto analyze and make sense of what it meant in their businesses.

These interviews & further studies reinforced that JotForm was a productivity tool; not just a way to make sign-up forms or payment sheets. 

They showed us that JotForm doesn‚Äôt provide online forms; we make organizations more productive. And this wake-up call revealed a truth we‚Äôve ignored for the last several years: we‚Äôve been too comfortable creating online forms. 

We thought our job was simply to battle it out in a crowded space with dozens of online form builders. Little did we know that listening to our customers would transform the very DNA of our business and define a completely new market.

Despite our 12 years in business, JotForm recently set out on this new journey that I‚Äôm happy to share with you today. 

The new PDF Editor that we've just launched represents the first step across that threshold. And it's a bold step forward for the whole company. 

It offers:

- Automation: A single online form can generate thousands of custom different PDFs - a new one created every time someone responds to your form. PDFs can also be sent to the submitter with autoresponder attachment & transferred automatically to cloud services such as Google Drive, Dropbox.

- Design: Not every submissions looks beautiful by default. PDF Editor allows you to create beautiful designs and customize them to your liking.

- Communication: Thanks to customized PDFs and built-in sharing/archiving, PDF Editor enables you to report back to your internal & external stakeholders easily.

- Durability: You can keep/archive your submission data in a formatted way.

If you have time, check it out and please let us know what you think. We‚Äôll be around today to hop in the comments.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this and have a great day!
Aytekin & JotForm Team
@justinleejw Thank you, Justin. We're also excited about this launch. We have been working on this tool for the last 6 month. It is an important milestone for us. 

Editing individual PDFs might seem like a solved problem. But, our new PDF Editor solves a different problem: How to create PDF files from your data on the fly. 

Let me give you an example. Let's say you designed a custom invoice design for your clients using the PDF Editor. When you need to create a new invoice, you can just enter the data on the form and the PDF is created on the fly which can easily be synchronized with cloud services such as Google Drive & Dropbox and shared with your clients.

We also have 100+ PDF templates so that you don't have to start from scratch.
@shreyaa_ratra Just like Word processors or spreadsheets, online forms or PDFs don't have a single industry or company size. They are used by everyone. 

We find our ideal customer profiles by interviewing our customers. Instead of the usual top-down approach, we prefer to analyze our most active users and look for common patterns among them. When they looked at our most active users, our UXR team found that they are using JotForm as a productivity tool. JotForm makes their jobs easier and saves them time. That's how we decided to create this product.
@fredrivett thank you, Fred, means so much ?

@donnyv No, but we are thinking about a portable keyboard.
@dimitrovskif no, as we've already give our best price for this keyboard, free shipping means we are losing money.
@seanwashington Currently we don't have a plan for it, but if there is enough demand, we will definitely consider, as we need to place a bulk order like 1k pcs to factory each time, we need to be careful of the cash flow. In case of emergency, you can call the police to prevent you get murder first ?
@babken_karapetyan I am not very clear, those Gateron and Cherry mx switch keyboards shows on our comparison video are traditional switch, but not low profile switch.
@cacarr For Linux, we didnt officially test it, but the Keytron works great on Mac and Windows system. If you use the keyboard on your ThinkPad, it suppose to be a rubber dome keyboard, then, our low profile switch will optimise your typing experience. Ultra-slim of Keytron is made because we want to create a slimmer keyboard with good tactile feeling, mechanical keyboard on the market are mostly bulky.

@zelena Palm runs Android, so you can use Find my phone.
@danielkempe We view Palm as sort of a super-wearable. A lot of people buy Apple Watch LTE with the intent of leaving their phone behind, but when they do- they leave behind their camera (and Snap/Instagram) as well as a whole bunch of their important message apps (Messengers, DMs).

Perfect for going to the gym, grabbing coffee, date night, or when you want to spend quality time with the family.
@joshuapinter Palm is a companion device that costs $10/month- similar to Apple Watch LTE.

However, you don't need a phone around to use your Palm. I use my Palm about 80% of the day.

Desk: laptop
Couch: Big phone
On-the-go: Palm

The more I detox, the easier it is to leave my big phone behind.
@oiv I've got 4 little boys. They love using ""dad's baby phone"".
@evivz We have only announced launches in U.S. (Verizon) and Europe (Vodaphone) for now. But we will be expanding as fast as we can!
@babken_karapetyan Available in the U.S. through Verizon. You can find more details at palm.com

Will be in Europe through Vodaphone next month!
@david_sanchez3 palm.com or just ask me ?
Hi everyone! I am the Head of Product for Palm and will be answering your questions throughout the day.

We made Palm to help people live outside of their screens and be more present. People love their 6"" rectangles (we do too!) and it's getting unhealthy. Sometimes we just need to less.

It is about the size of a credit card. I tuck mine in my minimalist wallet and can live my day like a normal human again.

Perfect for going for a run, date night, or weekends. Some people will want to make this their daily driver. There's no wrong way to use it.

You can also find us on Twitter/Instagram: @palm
@ayush_chandra We love Casey. He has been very supportive. He also shared a great photo to show the size of this thing: https://twitter.com/CaseyNeistat/status/1059926433026449408
@joshuapinter Same. I am 6'4"" and over 200 pounds and a smartphone is just too big for running. I carry it in my hand or wear a fanny-pack. Sometimes, you just need small.
@nagarajugajula Fits in a minimalist wallet!

@joseph_ayoub Thanks man! I appreciate the support.

1) We have announced a Vodaphone launch in Europe. Open market devices have not been announced yet.
2) Battery life is up to 2 hours of screen time, 3.5 hours of talktime, 5+ hours of LTE music streaming, or a 4+ hour workout. You can see full details here: https://palmsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016703131-How-long-is-Palm-s-battery-life-
@palm @thatmattgardner We have only announced launches in U.S. (Verizon) and Europe (Vodaphone) for now. But we will be expanding as fast as we can!

For battery, we followed mobile standards. *up to* generally implies that if you only do that thing and that thing only, the battery will last that long. So, 9.5 hours of local playback assumes you downloaded some Spotify playlists and played it for that long, doing minimal activity for anything else.";4;-2;True;True;False;creativity

1. You can upload pre-recorded files into our system and get the transcript 
2. If you have upcoming web-conferencing meetings on your calendar, you can invite fred@fireflies.ai to join the call, record those meetings, and transcribe it automatically for you. 
3. Mobile app is potentially in the pipeline (yes) if you need a way to get a transcription of an in person meeting you can have Fireflies call your cell number or record the call using your device and then later upload it to Fireflies :)

@rrhoover Interestingly a large segment of our users have been sales teams and folks using it in customer facing conversations. Those are also the teams that tend to adopt it more widely inside their orgs. Right now, there are several good sales enablement tools out on the market. Our primary goal for this launch was to showcase the workflow and sales automation capabilities that reps themselves use. That's been our forte in the past year. We are doing more custom offerings for sales and support teams as well on a team by team basis that need enablement capabilities :) Fundamentally, there is a lot of different ways to slice and dice conversational data.

Yeah, Google Lens will be the most widely-used ""visual assistant"" or maybe another new ADs platform based on their very massive data infrastructure, I think. But, in fact, our question was simple actually ""what is/should be a real usage of AR in our everyday life, instead of the 3D visual effect itself."" That is. So it might be/we will focus on the strongest real-time data crawler via the camera, instead of active-assistant itself. Also in the near future, it could be more ""socialized/crowded"" for its data on Cloud. Yes, the accuracy also will be fixed/improved with each user.

So our final goal is to turn the world into data for the people. yeah, actually not sure all the things about our future shape, but if I receive a bunch of vote from our  PH family, I will decide to develop with next plan. :)

Thanks @mrsimonbennett for the hunt ? 
I'm @geekuillaume, the creator of DBacked. While I was working on different projects, I tried to find the best way to backup my databases. Most of the available solutions are based on a small script in a cron job but it was lacking a big feature: being alerted if the backup was failing. I also wanted full E2E encryption and Docker support. That's why I created DBacked.

DBacked is a open-source command-line tool paired with an optional SaaS product. The tool is installed on your server and it creates, encrypt and send your database backup. It can be configured to store everything on your own AWS S3 Bucket or, with the Pro plan, directly on DBacked servers. Security is my priority and everything has been done to be sure your data is always available and cannot leak.

my name is Aleksey and here is my free icon pack <a href=""http://www.evericons.com/""><b>Evericons</b></a>.

As a product designer, I know that even raw mockups look nicer when they have proper icons. And I also know that a designer could spend a huge part of a project's time working on icons.

So several months ago I decided to create a tool for designers, that helps to focus on product creation and save time. Evericons is also useful for developers and entrepreneurs and allows them to create new websites, make apps, and build great products faster and cheaper.

And finally, today I'm so excited to share with you the first version of Evericons.

The current version has 420 well-crafted icons that are designed on a 24√ó24 grid, and additional 50 icons designed on 16√ó16 grid. I'm going to add more and more icons, so if you want to suggest a new icon, please fill this form.



<b>P.S.</b>
As a bonus level, I've included discount codes on the products I truly love, that were kindly provided by Avocode, Flawless App, IconJar, LSTORE, Realtime Board and Worksection.

@jensger Haha great question Jens! My thinking is I am not necessary the one who can make that decision. I haven't changed the tagline since I started to work on it, it might not be the most suitable one by now. I am just trying to make it easier to find people in a certain niche, to either just follow them or connect. For instance, I am really hoping the indie makers category will connect some people and have them work on something together. Or better yet, an Indie Maker finding a programmer/designer etc. ?I might have not found someone to be as interesting as that person found them to be, but who am I to make that decision, you know? ?

Hi PH,

‚ÅâÔ∏è Problem
Most of the time I work from a coffee shop with my laptop, and from time to time I'll leave to visit the toilet.
But whenever I go, I ? worry that someone might ? steal my laptop while I'm away.

? Solution
I tried to find an existing solution to protect my laptop, but none satisfied me. The existing apps are either too expensive (monthly subscription), not supported anymore or they don't work the way that I want. For example, many of them don't play the alarm sound when the display is closed, making it easy for the thief to run away.

So I decided to make my own perfect macOS security alarm app...

? How does it work?
If someone tries to steal my laptop (disconnect from the charger or close the display), MacBook Alarm detects it, sounds an alarm and sends a push notification to Telegram so I can capture the bad guy!

? Here is a video demo:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k898AK4ngC0
I making this launch live in <a href=""https://twitch.tv/Andrey_Azimov"">Twitch</a>. 

This app is a part of my Hard Core Year - I ? quit my job and I have 1 year to get to ? profit as an Indie Maker. You can <a href=""https://medium.com/@AndreyAzimov/i-quit-my-job-and-i-have-one-year-to-get-to-profitability-6159db01d9c2"">Read my story</a>.

Thanks, @rdev, and @gerasim_sergey who help with code.

? Let me know your feedback.
@wimgz Thanks. I thought about it but the chance that a webcam will shot will be a right photo is pretty low. So I decided to launch it without this feature but maybe in next version I will get back to it.

Great question. It comes down to simplifying the problem, and layering in unique personalization.

Hopper's goal is to predict exactly how prices will change in the future. We've simplified the problem by asking: are there any great deals available today? From our research and model development, prices are too erratic to make precise predictions about the future. Our customers have responded well to the simplicity and clarity of our recommendations. 

What we're really excited about are the personalization features built on top of the price discovery engine. This is where we see ourselves pulling away from the competition. Today, you can specify broader regions you'd like to travel to, and flexible travel dates. We're introducing Trips (PH launch coming soon!), which will let customers track specific travel plans, much like Hopper. Beyond that, we're building out awareness of airline miles and points, as well as flexible departure cities (think: resident of CT can leave from Boston or NYC). We're working closer with customers to make sure that our trip-planning tools map 1-to-1 with how they think about travel.

We've found it helpful to think of our product as more of a next-generation travel agent. Our sophistication comes from our ability to take more of our customer's needs into account, and understand their priorities beyond price. 

Hope that's helpful, and thanks so much for making this awesome community ?
Hey @amrith!

It's not just clickbait! ?

In our back-tests, we found that the deals we sent out are, on average, 50% cheaper than the average price for a given route (excluding holidays). It turns out that booking at the right time has a huge impact on price, so sniping the moment when tickets go on sale is essential.

P.S. Thanks again for helping me with my Twitter handle yesterday ?

@dilan Actually yes! Have been floating this idea in my mind, definitely some kind of 1-way import from different frameworks and sql scripts will be in place by the end of the year ? 

Now having 2-way sync, that would be even more useful imo, though need to think through that more since implementation can be tricky.

  * How much money they make per month?

  * How many people downloaded their app?

I try to guess those numbers based on their Alexa rank, number of followers on different social networks, number of app installs on Google play, visiting Crunchbase page, etc. Sometimes there's more precise numbers.

Fortunately, number of entrepreneurs who started to share their numbers are increasing. You might saw few of them in a blog post, a page on website(/open), a tweet, a post on IndieHacker or Reddit, or even in Baremetrics. Those are great sources, but scattered numbers.

So I thought about developing a website and share those numbers inside. Any number from any source that I see around the web. That's how <a href=""http://bareproduct.com""><b>BareProduct</b></a> started.

@aaronoleary The single biggest differentiator is player ownership. When you purchase a pack of tokens or an individual player token, you own the token(s) forever. The tokens can be used in weekly games, and will be useful in future applications like live Q+A with the athlete. If at any point you want to get rid of a token, you'll also be able to sell it on the Hashletes marketplace.
@aaronoleary With the foundation being player ownership, the application ecosystem really opens up. One example of that is Multiplayer, a game we'll be releasing soon, where you'll be able to build teams with your friends to compete for the weekly cash prizes.

Last time, when I launched <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nomad-hubb"">nomad(hubb)</a>, people seemed to resonate with the project‚Ä¶ but they really seemed to resonate with my story of learning to code for the last 9 months and <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1RdHXh6n1WkB6junPdseT_Ec4AEM1WQych3i6byMZBFo/edit#gid=0https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BhVxO6ViqWe7b0G5gqUrrVB7bbdpowqs9LTsuvoRcYs/edit?usp=sharing"">tracking my progress</a> throughout.

? So when @marie_dm_ announced that Women Make was doing a 30-day challenge, I set out with a goal to somehow quantify the shift in my mindset that has allowed me to learn/do/make more since February. 

?After 8 days of procrastinating, I realized I took a hard look at how I was spending my time and thus, the idea was born. 25 days later, here is MYGA - a digital ‚Äúlook in the mirror‚Äù. 

? It's meant to be a personal reflection tool to help you better understand how you spend your time, and thus your life. You can add activities, track your weekly time spend, and explore tools that may help you on your path to ""being great"".

?Let me know what you think! What are your ""multipliers""? Mine personally was 1.9, but can honestly say that prior to focusing on coding, it was probably closer to a 5. ?
@deadcoder0904 Thanks Akshay!! ?It's been a fun ride. I'm glad MYGA was helpful!
Thank you @marie_dm_! So happy you organized the challenge. I would've taken ages to finish it if we we didn't have a deadline. Hope MYGA will help you moving forward!
Thank you!! @anthilemoon ????
@graeme_fulton Wait you spend 5x more on opportunities?! That is the lowest I've seen. Good on you - killin' life!
@booligoosh Thanks Ethan! That's super good. Congrats on making good life choices ?
@c10v32c1u6 Thank you! I really appreciate that you recognize that! Cannot wait to try Bloom very soon! ?
@tcodinat Thank you, Toni! I swear I responded to this earlier but idk what happened ?. I totally agree - it's so easy to look track at time and loose a week or month or year.  So excited to see your project!
@pierrahh_ Thank you!! So happy it's useful to you.
@graeme_fulton Hahah totally ?????
@dilan Great point! A few people have brought this up so I guess I should look into whether I can plug into apps like RescueTime. Glad you've been able to spend less time on social - I'm still working on this!
@dinkydani21 Thank you!!! ?
@greaterthan1000 Hi Sam! I actually hadn't considered this. I added a sleep/work section which is only triggered if you want to edit it (it's subtle) but could add a school section. Let me know how I can help you create this! I could make some simple changes and make a school-specific version. Feel free to message or email me: hello@stephsmith.io :)
@anthonygawonlee Fair enough! I considered other names for a long time, but in this case I felt like this actually got the message across best. I think I'll branch out for my next project! ?
@devduttabhosale Thank you so much Dave! ?
@diego_souza21 No: https://begreat.me/about

- A political statement
@anthonygawonlee Thank you so much! ?
@ktrxs Thank you!! ? ? ?
@brady_endres That's amazing, Brady! So far, I've found it rare when anyone gets less than 1 so you're living a great life!
@joe_voeghan If you explore the tool more, it also allows you to track your results over time and suggests tools for improvement. ?  A ""product"" doesn't need to be AI-powered to be a product and there are so many products out there that are simple, but deliver value.
@tabish_gilani No worries, I had the same reaction when I did the exercise myself. I still spend way too much time on social! Hopefully this will be the kick in the butt we need! ?";4;-4;True;True;False;web development

Let me begin with thanking @chrismessina for hunting Mobile Patterns.

It was in 2012 that Mobile Patterns was first presented to the design community with an aim to introduce the most efficient and innovative UX trends. 

4 years of curating the gallery and building a hub of over 20,000 designers it became a source of inspiration for the key players in the design process.

However, in 2016, I began my research to enhance Mobile Patterns. After having interviewed more than 500 professionals, I observed a gap between the static images and the designers‚Äô imagination.

Hence, to narrow this gap I re-engineered the website with two new key features:

1. Hover over Videos & GIFs to witness micro-interactions & UX flows come alive
2. Top Search Bar for swift results.

Come, tell us what you like about MOBILE PATTERNS, and how we can become your all-inclusive design vault!

We are excited to hear from you!

Hi, hunters, ???

I‚Äôm Dragos from <a href=""https://netcrumb.com"">Netcrumb</a>. I‚Äôm really happy that after a few months of work this web app is finally live. First of all, I want to thank you for reading this listing and to @chrismessina for hunting us.

<b>What problem is Netcrumb solving?</b>

Have you ever built a Wordpress website? 

The usual process looks like this:
1. Find a design.
2. Search for a Wordpress theme that meets your design criteria.
3. Buy it from a marketplace or ask some developer to code it.
4. Install the theme and understand how to get the promised design when you bought it. 
5. Understand how the Wordpress theme works 
6. Learn how it‚Äôs builder works ( most of them are clunky and not very user friendly. )

By the time you have figured all this things out it will be hours, days or even weeks, depending on your experience. 

<b>Do you want to wait that much to have a simple Wordpress website done?</b>

I don‚Äôt and that is why I built this app.

<b>How Netcrumb works and why it is better than other Wordpress builders?</b>

1. Select a category, color palette and fonts
2. Add text and more sections like About Us, Contact Us, Features, Services, Testimonials, FAQ, Checklist, Pricing etc. ( No drag and drop ) 
3. Save, buy and download the Wordpress theme.
4. Once you create the design, Netcrumb app will convert everything into a Wordpress theme zip file. 

When you install it on your website, no more customisation is required. Is that easy!

Disclaimer: Being the first version of the product, it lacks some features, but there are on our roadmap.

A blog link for your website will be automatically added in your footer if you wrote any posts.

You can check <a href=""https://netcrumb.com"">Netcrumb's website footer.</a>

<b>What are the PROs and CONs of using Netcrumb?</b>

<i>PROs</i>

- Fast ( Saves you at least a few hours of work)
- Easy to use
- Beautiful designs
- Unlimited edits
- Export on your laptop
- Responsive
- The website that you create loads fast ( Test my Site from Google gave us between 3-5s loading time for our tests )

<i>CONs</i>

- Only one page WordPress sites
- Limited designs
- Manually download and install the theme

<b>How much does it cost to create a Wordpress website with Netcrumb?</b>

$ 19.

I would write more, but I invite you to take a look on our website and please ask me any questions that you have.

Thank you,

Dragos.
@aaronoleary Hi. Thank you. Yes. Planning on adding more or maybe creating something that will work on more industries.

1Kprojects is the first project out of my challenge to overcome maker paralysis by shipping a new product every 2 weeks, so far it's going great!

? I've always wanted to just buy a cool project on a whim, without thinking much about it. But that's something I've never been able to do due to the high prices and low quality websites available on marketplaces like flippa. And like all of us makers, I have many abandoned projects, that I know other people would find valuable.

?That's why I made 1Kprojects, which is a curated marketplace where makers can buy and sell neglected side projects for less than $1000.

?As a buyer, you get a weekly email with the latest curated projects, all priced $1k or less.

?As a seller, you can put unlimited projects on sale, completely for free, and only pay when you actually get legitimate offers ( all offers are manually approved ).

?Let me know what you think about the model, and how you think I can improve the product to better fit your needs as a buyer or a seller.

Thank you!
@mickc79 Thanks for the feedback, and apologies for this. I've increased the limit to 1500KB. If you still have the page open, you can just resubmit the form without having to write everything from scratch again.

If not, I'll see if I can find a way to get your initial submission back and contact you directly.
@pastelpad Not at the moment. Sellers can reach out to buyers and discuss the details of the sale privately.

@mickc79 @jakeboyles Apologies for the inconvenience. I've already increased the screenshot limit size to 1500 KB so I'm not sure what issue you had while submitting ?
@samcreamer Completely agree, I've already denied two submissions of sites similar to what you're describing.
@andreyazimov Will do in a few days if it makes sense. Thank you for the kind words ( And the inspiration ;) )
@bhatnagar_san Currently, a $19 one time fee is required to unlock all past and future offers of a specific projects. 

I say currently because I'm still gathering feedback from sellers about this model.

But so far, the people who purchased it say they didn't regret purchasing and are getting value out of it.

Your feedback is appreciated as well!
@taxodapp Thank you, good to have you with us.
@bhatnagar_san @prakis That's a good idea that I'm definitely considering, but still need some more feedback from the existing sellers. I don't feel like I'm forcing anyone to pay though, with the current model, I've tried as best as I could to make the payment worth it for the seller, compared to the traditional listing fee with no guarantees to get any offers.
@zelena The way it works is that you explain the project to the best of your ability, even if there is no link ( screenshot required though ), and then buyers get in touch with you for more details if needed. You can then privately discuss how to provide access or demo the project.
@zelena I suggest submitting the project since it's free, and then see how things work out.";5;-2;True;True;False;web development

FPVtips is all about helping you discover new places to fly FPV (First Person View) drones at and share your photos and videos with the FPV community.

Drones wut? Let me take a step back :)

Flying FPV racing / freestyle quadcopters is a very fun and exciting hobby that would be perfect all around if it weren't for 2 flaws:

- It is expensive to get into
- It could be techy and daunting at first

I can't do much about the first one, but heck, I could try to ease off the latter! Enter, fpvtips.com

Since getting into the hobby I have been blogging about repairs and upgrades for drones over at https://blog.georgi-yanev.com for a little over a year and have been helping about ~ 600 - 1000 people monthly.

I thought I could do more and started FPVtips with the ultimate goal of getting more people into the hobby.

To achieve that we want to help pilots share the spots they like flying (photos and videos) and get together to fly with other pilots.
We also want to enable beginnners and provide them with accessible and to-the-point information.

This launch is not the end, only the beginning with many updates and information coming to fpvtips.com soon.

P.S.: If you have never tried flying a racing drone FPV I can only recommend that you give it a shot, it's a great experience.";4;-2;True;True;False;creativity

I agree with adding a starter tier, I'll go ahead and add a 1 domain for $2/month plan with unlimited inboxes for people getting started. I wanted to stay away from a free plan to make sure I'm working on something people would pay for and to prevent possible spam issues.
@ayush_chandra Thanks! Any emails you receive should go to your normal inbox, and during the DNS setup, you'll see the SPF/DKIM records to make sure outbound emails don't have any issues as well.
@samuelroy_ Thanks for letting me know about this! I‚Äôve used G Suite for a long time but I had always thought it was one domain per account. It looks like with a domain alias, you maintain the same inboxes as your primary domain but can receive emails from another domain. I just went through the process for adding a domain and I found it a bit complicated/there‚Äôs no clear separation between domains.

I‚Äôm not trying to replace G Suite, and it definitely has it‚Äôs place (I‚Äôm using it for Sidemail). When working on my other projects I needed a quick way to get the domain and a couple inboxes setup and this isn‚Äôt G Suites main focus.

@ethosventures bought up some great points on pricing and I‚Äôll be adding a cheaper starter plan as well ($2/month for the first domain with unlimited inboxes). With G Suite the cost is per account, and this could add up if you're working with different people on different ideas.

I really believe it pays (in 2018) for all developers (and especially those of use who've spent most of our time doing ""back-end development"") to understand the fundamentals for front-end development.

I wrote this because I don't think you need to spend weeks studying front-end to feel more confident when you encounter something written in Javascript!

Three months ago I made a Telegram chat bot to help me achieve lucid dreams more easily.
After coding for 12+ hours straight I had a first version and I proudly shared it to Reddit.
I went to bed and woke up to so much comments and upvotes: I wasn't the only one in need!
After a few days I had 250+ users...

That is when I decided to extend the chat bot and build a service to make is more easy for people to achieve lucid dreaming. I set out a scope of features and dived in. It has been an awesome journey, which I wrote about here: https://medium.com/@Aidenbuis/how-i-build-the-saas-of-your-dreams-d4c9a60d4035

If you are unfamiliar with what lucid dreaming is, please watch the explainer video. If you have any questions about LucidDreamBot, Lucid Dreams in general or anything else, I'll be here! 

Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@hotgeart The true motivation behind building this project... 

But in all seriousness haha, lucid dreaming is a very interesting concept.
Next to living out cool fantasies and wishes you can utilize to solve problems, conquer certain fears and even practice certain skills, like public speaking. 

The musician Aphex Twin used lucid dreaming as a tool to come up with new music for his album 'Selected Ambient Works Volume II'. He went to sleep in his own studie and when he became lucid in his dream, he dreamed up a music studio (shout out to @yoroomie for launching Studiotime 2.0 today to supply the real life studios). In the studio there were all sorts of alien instruments which he would play. Then after hearing the strangest sounds and composing melodies, he would awake himself and immediately try to recreate it.

Many possibilities!

Thank you @anthilemoon ! :)
Thank you @eothmane !
It is interesting, because I also had lucid dream experiences as a kid, but lost it when I grew up. Some other people I spoke with also had this. I think it is common. Let's reconquer our dreams! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback about using it :-)
Thank you for the extensive feedback @owenfar1 !
I'll look into the conversion after the launch and iterate if necessary.
If you have further ideas or feedback, please let me know :)

Thank you Ben! @harowitzblack
Yes, it can definitely be hard to stay motivated and keep at it! Even with LucidDreamBot the work will be there, but it will be streamlined and made much easier. I will be iterating it further and a big part of my energy will be focussed on the habit and motivation aspect. Think Duolingo meets Headspace to achieve Lucid Dreams ?
Thanks @forestanderson !

Yes, dreams are very personal. As it is sensitive data, every dream journal gets encrypted with the advanced encryption standard and a key size of 256 bits (AES-256). It would take 1038 Tianhe-2 Supercomputers running for the entirety of the existence of everything to exhaust half of the key space of a AES-256 key.

If you are a maker and find it hard to attract new users beyond launch day, this is for you. ‚ú®

Before starting building my own products, I studied marketing, and worked at Google as a marketing manager, so I know a thing or two about marketing. I also know that lots of traditional methods simply don't work for indie makers. ?

In this book, I'm ditching anything that costs $ and I'm focusing on affordable, simple, proven methods that will help you:

‚Ä¢ Define your personal brand
‚Ä¢ Grow your audience in an authentic & sustainable way
‚Ä¢ Get featured in the press
‚Ä¢ Speak at events in front of relevant people
‚Ä¢ Build your own community

It's available on Kindle via <a href=""https://a.co/d/dmIWrPn"">Amazon</a>, or you can download the extended version in PDF, EPUB, MOBI with extra content on <a href=""https://gum.co/makeandshine"">Gumroad</a>.

@chris_crompton1 @combatdavey Arg! I think we may be running into server issues from traffic.. diving in on this now
@brandynmorelli It's similar for sure (and Kevin and Akash have built a killer product, we're paying customers of KeywordKeg), but I believe KE is using the suggestions/related terms API vs. scraping specific data elements out of the actual Google SERP (which is what we're doing) -- the thinking here is that instead of just relying on Google to give ""suggestions"" on related terms, we're getting the actual terms they are using to train their ML algo (RankBrain).
@paco_vermeulen2 most of the upvotes likely came before the server started crashing.. which is what's happening at the moment and we're trying to fix afap.

This is my first real product launch ?

I'm an illustrator and designer from Sydney, and I love working on tech and editorial illustrations with startups and blogs.

I wanted to help companies and developers get access to more illustrations to use on their projects, to create beautiful landing pages, apps, websites etc, without breaking the bank.

I love the concept behind products like unDraw and wanted to add two more styles to the mix of what‚Äôs available out there, to give more options, as well as the different format of PSD files. 

DrawKit includes both free and paid illustrations, an equal number of both, with no difference in quality between the two. Use them without attribution on whatever you would like!

Features:

- Two different styles, depending on the voice of your brand
- Fully customisable, layered PSD download
- All colours can be easily changed within the PSD template
- PNG downloads included
- I've included a Requests page, so add what you're looking for and I'll illustrate the most upvoted
- Constantly updated, with new illustrations almost every day
- All hand-drawn on an iPad Pro

I know the library is relatively small right now, but it won't stay that way for long ? I'm averaging 2-4 new illustrations a day at the moment, so if you think you'll find this useful I would love it if you followed along as I grow the library to hundreds of illustrations.

I'll be drawing live on Twitch for a few hours today, come and hang out! I'll put the link here when I go live ? EDIT: Going live now: https://www.twitch.tv/jamesdaly90 

I hope you find it useful ?

We occasionally hear about the unscalable things founders did via interviews, podcasts and Medium posts. There‚Äôs no single home for these hacks however, so I decided to build a crowdsourced database with real stories, from real people.";1;-1;False;False;True;Long;Medium;No;No;Discover new unscalable ways to grow your startup;Long;No;No;No;No;0;No;No;Yes;165894;Leandro;Yes;No;Low;Few;Yes;500004;KP;Yes;Yes;Low;Yes;"Hi Product Hunters, I‚Äôm KP, a 2x founder and indie maker. Thanks so much to @leandro8209 for hunting my latest side hustle: ‚ÄúDo Things That Don‚Äôt Scale‚Äù.

I built this simple platform to make it easy for makers and founders to discover unscalable startup hacks and growth stories. The site‚Äôs data is crowd-sourced currently but will be quality checked manually by me. (doing an unscalable thing myself!)

As you may have guessed, the original inspiration for this platform came from Paul Graham‚Äôs <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"">popular article</a>. But the real booster came from the unbelievable engagement my simple post on <a href=‚Äùhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18400020‚Äù>Hacker News</a> attracted last week. The post asking founders asking to share their own personal stories and hacks reached top #2 on the home page that day and ended up with 260+ comments.

Right after that, I figured there should be a home for all of these stories and advice. Hence built a quick platform over a weekend. This platform is an easy-to-access repository for several unscalable hacks covering every type of founder/market. Be it B2B, B2C or hardware, you will find something useful on the site. 

Thanks to Paul Graham, Sam Altman, Patrick Collison and many other hackers on Hacker News who not only inspired me to create this list but also contributed to it. I‚Äôm hoping to see many more community contributions as it reaches more people. 

If you have a story or a hack that would be worth sharing, please click on the ‚ÄúAdd a hack‚Äù in the menu and submit your entry. I‚Äôll review it and add it in due time. 

? I‚Äôm really looking forward to your feedback and suggestions!

@daviswbaer thank you, glad you like it.
@5harath thank you. I agree. The early days of being a founder can be bumpy and it would be massively valuable if you could sift through a bunch of proven hacks and find something relevant for your situation.
@graeme_fulton Thanks Graeme, I'd love to see your submissions come through.
@lubo Thanks so much Lyubomir. The responses and the hacks people shared just this morning with me so far have blown my mind. I'm excited to publish them next week. (11/21) Keep an eye out.. super crazy stories!
@guillaumebardet thanks man yes quite humbled by the response so far!
@leandro8209 I love that -- it strips a lot of gloss. Quite frankly, a lot of what I read about Stripe through popular media was debunked when I found out how hard they hustled. We need real early stage founder stories and this is a simple attempt.

Hi everyone!

I wanted to make something useful that all my friend and family could use. It's not easy coming up with and building such an idea but I think this might be it.

I named it Tinyfollow, a smarter way to stay connected, one following at a time. Tinyfollow lets you control how you follow each individual. Currently, it only lets you follow people on Twitter but more integrations are their way and I think you'll still find it useful. Even if you've never used Twitter before, you can follow public figures like Elon Musk and Tinyfollow will help you stay up to date.

Try it out and if have any suggestions, let me know in the comments.

Thanks!
Charles
Thanks @mnlfrgr!

You're the second person that asked me this today (<a href=""https://twitter.com/chaibizi/status/1064184920514400257"">Tweet link</a>).

Currently, it is the former but I'm planning to add customizable lists (kind of like YouTube playlists).
Maybe this should have been the tagline ?

""The best way to follow tweets, with or without Twitter""
This is one of my use cases too ?
The biggest challenge was building the distributed task queue that was customizable from the users. Twitter stuff was easy ?

Now, adding support for other sources of data (RSS, Reddit, Hacker News, Instagram, maybe Facebook) should be pretty straightforward.
This means a lot. Thank you.

And thanks for being one of the early adopters.
This is probably the top priority to help people get more out of the product.

I already started working on getting the current following list of users:
https://www.tinyfollow.com/twitter/friends (Must be logged in via Twitter)

Hey, fellow hunters!

I've built Get Meta API during <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/the-24-hour-startup-challenge"">The 24 Hour Startup Challenge</a> to power my main product <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/telepost"">Telepost</a> .

Get Meta allows getting meta information from a page such as a title, description, Twitter & Open Graph data (used by many services including Facebook). All you need is to provide an URL to a web page, and you'll get JSON with available data.

See the demo: https://getmeta.info/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetmeta.info

It was a fun ride building it, you can read about my experience in a blog post ""Building a startup in 5 hours"": https://goindie.xyz/post/building-a-startup-in-5-hours-2jacuj3ze0muq

I'm planning to continue growing the project by adding new features and making it faster. I will be doing it in a backward compatible way, so you can start using it without worrying that it might break one day.

? There are some products of which I'm a huge fan, e.g. DigitalOcean (my server host) and Revolut (fintech).
So I'm talking about it and recommending it to my friends all the time!

? <b>Problem</b>

But what I realized is these 2 companies have referral programs, so if I refer a friend we both get a bonus (like free credits). All this time I could have been sending my friends gifts instead of just bugging them!

?<b>Solution</b>

I built Product Love so you can check if a product you love has a win-win referral program.
This means that the person being referred should get a gift (like free credits, first order free, etc), so it's not just spam.
Also usually the person sending the link gets credits available only in the app, so there is no incentive if you don't like the products.
Imagine if I refer all my buddies to Digital Ocean but I don't really like the product, I will end up with infinite DO credits which are useless if I don't use it!!
This way we make sure it's not just spam for the money.

?Ô∏è <b>Startegy</b>
I built this product in 10 hours, live on Twitch during the #24hrstartup challenge.
(You can read all the journey <a href='https://twitter.com/wimgz/status/1063709757264015360'>here on Twitter</a>)
I did this to make a MVP as fast as possible, so that you can start adding your favorite products right now.
Of course there are some bugs and design fixes to make.
But now I can start the grunt work of adding every product and SaaS on earth in the following weeks.
Also I have more than a concept to show, so I can pitch customers

? You can help me by adding all your favorite products and I will check for you if they have a refer-a-friend program!
@anthilemoon thanks! This is just the start I will add more products in the next days!";3;-4;True;True;False;creativity

I just finished the <a href=""https://24hrstartup.com/steph"">24h challenge</a>, where I made Eunoia. 

? I've been nomading around for a few years now and have always found it super interesting to find words that only exist in one particular language. Often I find that word, in some way, represents that culture pretty closely. For example, Ikigai, Kaizen, and Karoshi in Japanese. 

?‚Äç?I wanted to create a searchable directory where people could find words that were interesting to them (ex: tags like ""personal growth"") or search by specific languages to get a better sense of that particular culture.

?I stumbled upon the word Eunoia which in Latin means, ""well-thinking"" or ""beautiful mind"" which I felt like pretty well represented the uniqueness of these words and cultures.

?If you'd like to watch how this was created, you can access my stream <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/stephsmithio"">here</a>. If you enjoy Eunoia, you can vote for it as part of the 24h challenge <a href=""https://24hrstartup.com/products/eunoia"">here</a>.

As many makers this weekend, I took part in the <a href=""https://24hrstartup.com/anne-laure-le-cunff"">24hr Startup Challenge</a>, and decided to build <a href=""https://teenybreaks.com/"">Teeny Breaks</a>, a simple Chrome extension that allows you to incorporate mindfulness into your workflow. ?

Every time you open a new tab, Teeny Breaks shows you a mindfulness tip so you can make the most of your break. ?

Guaranteed no BS: each tip is science-based, with a link to the corresponding research paper should you want to learn more. And I will keep on adding new tips now and then! ? 

You can get it for Chrome <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/teeny-breaks/gfcfendehdonmfflgpkkaijdfbafkdfa/related"">here</a>, and I'll port it to Brave as soon as it supports customizing new tabs.

It was a lot of fun to build and I hope to be sending out lots of positive messages over the next year! 

I originally wanted to build a ""SMS Reminders"" app. But when I did a search there were already hundreds  of those. I told my partner Cara about the idea and she suggested that I build a service that allows people to send nice messages to their loved one. And so ThoughtfulSMS was born.

The app currently has 4 collections to pick from:

?Love - Perfect for those people you just cant live without

?Motivation - For the people that love to get up early and kiss-ass

‚¨ÜÔ∏èUplifting - Leaves everyone feeling great about life

?Affirmation - Perfect for those that need a confidence boost

I've also got a lot of other collections in the pipeline!

You *need* to be close to each other. Using a genie is the most comfortable, yet most expressive way to chat like this (i.e. you could be on the toilet yet you still feel like you're showing ""face"" :p)
@akashrnigam @rrhoover @akash_nigam @chrismessina We don't believe one can quantify art. We look for reactions :) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFlcqWQVVuU 

Regarding your 2nd point about attention, that's pretty much what drives IG/Snapchat teen behavior these days. Get attention (indirectly) from the people you care about. Kids are experts in this without even realizing it. Sending a snap, posting a story, posting an actual post, liking a post etc. are all ways to indirectly get attention from the 3-5 people you actually care about getting attention from. 

We built behavior into Genies where you can let everyone know you're online or just one person. Ping your crush with no worries - they have no clue how many people you pinged.
@roberta_moede_carrington After you create your genie, you'll arrive at a screen where you can either invite a friend (if you don't have any friends on the app yet) OR if you already have friends on the app you'll get to the main screen where you can tap the silhouette genie in the top left to invite friends :)

@ayush_chandra Hm, odd. Have you updated the app today?
@akashrnigam @rrhoover @akash_nigam @themikehorton teens definitely use iMessage! No disagreement there. It's just not built for self-expression and it's an agenda-driven platform most of the time, meaning if i message you it's usually about something specific (similar to a phone call for older demos). This creates the formal ""vibe"" that surrounds it. If that's not the case and teens happen to be having an iMessage conversation, then they are most likely using it synchronously while procrastinating on let's say, homework. Hanging out, gossiping, talking about nothing. But again, that lacks context and expression. They want to hangout. They want to be close to each other while they are far apart. iMessage etc. isn't built for that. Video can be too aggressive. Genies fit in nicely here.";3;-4;True;True;False;web development

Let me begin by thanking @thisiskp_ for hunting my product ‚ÄîTools for Makers.

This is Sharath, 2 time founder, designer and recently turned indie maker. Last week I challenged myself to build a product without writing code. Thanks to @bentossell, @mubashariqbal I found many no-coding tools via newCo. ?

Table2site.com is one of them. Inspired by @bramk‚Äôs Startup Stash ?I built a simple platform that features tools made by indie makers which are verified by Product Hunt community. Meaning almost all the tools are named as either Product of the Day or Product of the Week. My motive behind this idea is to support the indie maker community by curating the best tools in the market all at one place. Not to discard some of the best products that give us inspiration I‚Äôve also featured many famous well-known tools. The unique card design layout comes with pricing, free trial info and a brief description of the product which gives users visibility to browse and power to explore multiple categories.

As I said this is my first product as a indie maker, I can‚Äôt be more excited to share with you all. Huge shoutout to @PoeHaH for an incredible support throughout this process ?

I‚Äôm going to add tools/resources every week so that the platform will be up to date. Can you think of a tool I should add? Or maybe categories or other suggestions? Let me know, I'd love to hear it! ?

Thank you for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è

@guillaumebardet Thanks. I'm glad you liked the curated list. Feel free to suggest tools that I missed. I'll add them shortly.
@poehah @graeme_fulton Thanks. My motive is to make maker life easy. Happy to include Prototypr as I feel the maker community needs to know how impactful your tool is.
@bramk, you made my day. Thanks thanks thanks. ?
Hey @seunoyebode. Thank you so much. Appreciate your support.
@thisiskp_ Thanks for your kind words. As makers to see all these tools under one platform gives us more reasons to ship more simple products. By doing so we are supporting maker community and fulfilling our maker dreams at the same time. Glad so many people are appreciating the curation.
Thanks @anthilemoon So glad that you liked it. I already have 15+ new tools which I'm going to add. The platform will be up-to-date so that the maker community will take advantage of it.
Thanks @rhettwithey. I agree the list not only useful but will ease the process of building and shipping products.
Hey @anna_0x. Thanks for the feedback. There is one tool under Resume Builder - ""My Resume Format"". Also now you can suggest your tool in the Typeform. I just added the option.

@vladkorobov oh you mean instead of the trial period. I definitely agree, I want to move everything to a freemium! Just need to get there :) I think it would be better than the current trial period for sure!
@tabish_gilani Thank you Tabish! Would love to get in touch and learn how you think would be a good strategy to help grow everyday!

1) When you hit subscribe to pay for the app or when you first sign up? This shouldn't be happening in any case so I'll investigate what may be wrong!
2) Interesting, maybe I should make a softer transition or give some explanation of how the app works. The onboarding needs an overall improvement for sure!
3) Point taken!
4) Hehe now that you say it it's true. I initially used subscribe to make it obvious that it was a subscription and not a one time payment (transparency) but I'm sure renaming it to Premium or Upgrade might be less confusing.

Thanks for the feedback! :))

Excited to launch this on PH today! Thanks to @_jacksmith for the hunt ?

We've all heard about how important networking is, regardless of if you're searching for a new job, wanting to expand your professional contacts, or just learning more about an industry.

But, how are you supposed to grow and cultivate that network? How do you email your old and existing contacts without coming across as sleazy?

<a href=""https://networkingemails.com"">Networking Emails</a> solves that. It's a collection of a bunch of great email templates that cover a number of networking situations, including how to: 
- cold email alumni 
- follow up with someone you met at an event
- write effective LinkedIn connection request notes
- follow up if you don't hear back,
- ask an industry leader for advice,
- ask your network for an interview,
and a ton more!

I sourced the initial set of templates from people in my network (colleagues, friends and friends of friends who went to business school, etc) and personal emails, and I'm adding to the list of templates every week. Every template also includes some insight on why the email was effective, to help you craft better emails.

Each of these emails has amazing copy and actually worked ?(i.e. got an interview, a response, etc). Each template was also tweaked, so obviously names (e.g. company names, people names, etc) were changed for confidentiality. 

Any feedback or feature requests, let me know! ?

Thanks! ?

FreePizza.io connects those who want pizza for tech meetups, usergroups, hackathons and tech talks with those who wish to sponsor the pizza - typically employers, software companies, SAAS companies and recruiters. In return, the sponsor gets a promotional message opportunity at the event.

Background is I noticed that tech meetups, usergroups, hackathons and tech talks often have pizza and drinks for attendees for dinner.

And I thought ""Who pays for the pizza?""

I'm both a programmer and a recruiter, so I figured, hey maybe I should connect those who need pizza with those who want to sponsor the pizza.

We've only been launched for one week and have been lucky enough to have more than 17 events seeking more then $3,500 pizza posted, 2 events have been sponsored!! And we spent the whole day on the front page of Hacker News https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18434156  I really can't say how deeply appreciative I am of this early support.

So if you want to advertise your SAAS to a highly engaged audience, if you want to find new employees, if you want to find new clients, then sponsor the pizza at an event now!

I'd love to hear from you - thanks

@rdlou @eivindml Hi Eivind, I get what you meant, and it makes sense. Though thinking closely it could actually work. Thanks for the suggestion
@rrhoover @huangdun Wow Dun, it seems your reply wasn't very well thought out. That's a ripoff of another bottle opener released years ago which is more than 2x as big as the Claw. 

Upon testing, those that were bought from Aliexpress got dented and lost their structure, while pieces flew off others.

Do let me know if you find a ripoff Claw, we can file a design patent claim so they can't mess with our customers too.

Hi all,

wavey.tips is a small tool I created a while back to gather links together in one place with an easy to share link. The idea behind it is to start small and constantly evolve the tool based on how users are interacting with it.

In many ways this launch is an experiment for something I built in less than 3 weeks? Looking forward to seeing the open and honest feedback and if the tool even has a use case. In a way, using Product Hunt to validate the idea ?

One of the key ideas of the tool is to stay as simple as possible, essentially WSIWYG. 

Have a great day and look forward to your thoughts.

I was tired of not being able to find the same page I found at an earlier time during critical moments. 

Now you can save just about any page exactly the way you saw it and even highlight the parts that are most important for quick referencing. I want anyone whose ever worried about closing tabs to know that they can access the pages they worked hard to find. I give everyone who makes an account a free gigabyte of storage to save all the pages you want. When you save a page, WebSatchel indexes all the words on that page so you don't have to remember what words were in the title, just any string of words that you can remember.

The service works best if you use it often. Save any page you visit that you might want to comeback to. If a page doesn't save you can report it and we will actively work on fixing the issue. Personally, I used it to save any Black Friday deals I found while shopping around online. 

Hope you guys enjoy the service and don't hesitate to leave comments and feedback as we are actively working on making the service better and easier to use. New features are coming soon such as being able to save all your currently open tabs into a ""Collection"" and open them back up whenever you want! Thanks guys for the support! And happy Satcheling!";3;-4;True;True;False;community

I'm excited to share Altitude today, the busiest air travel day of the year.

<b>Backstory</b>
On October 21, my 30th birthday, I traveled to my 100th country. This was an ambitious goal that I set a few years back and one that normally would have cost a fortune to accomplish.  I had to figure out how to do it affordably.

In the process, I used every flight deal tool and tracker out there. I then built tools that I wished existed to help track airfare prices, monitor airfare trends, and seek out the best deals to places around the world. I learned everything associated with frequent travel, including airline quirks, the best airports to transit through, ins-and-outs of frequent flier programs, top travel gear, and much more.

My friends and family became interested in what I was doing and started asking me questions about how to travel so much for so little and wanted me to notify them about flight deals. 

This is how Altitude was born.

‚úàÔ∏è Altitude is your go to site for flight deals and travel tips that will help you become a more savvy adventurer.

<b>?Curated, Quality Deals</b>
I‚Äôve flown on nearly every major global airline. Every deal that is shared on Altitude has to be one that I myself would travel on. This means no crazy layovers, unreliable budget carriers, or terrible three-stop itineraries. 

<b>?Customizable</b>
Instead of sending one mass deal to all members, you will receive an email or SMS text that is tailored to your preferences. Looking for deals to a certain part of the world? Flights departing specific airports? Or looking to flights on a specific airline to earn elite status? Altitude has customizable filters you can configure.

<b>?Domestic + International Coverage</b>
Altitude watches for both international and domestic deals departing from all major US airports. You can have as much fun in Paris, France as you can in Paris, Texas and Altitude caters to both audiences. 

<b>?Destination Insights</b>
Travel is meant to be fun. Each deal is sent with at least one tip about the destination. Insights might include favorite restaurants I've visited at a specific destination, hotel recommendations, or sights that cannot be missed.

<b>?Education</b>
A big component of Altitude is the travel tips and tutorial sections, which will continue to grow every week. Members have access to all posts and can suggest future ideas and topics to be covered.

<b>?‚Äç?‚Äç?‚Äç? Ad Free + Member Supported</b>
Altitude is 100% member supported and ad free, which means my only motivation is to help you save money and travel smart. There are no referral links, affiliate links or credit card sales pitches on the site. 

<b>? Here To Help</b>
Most importantly I want to help people get out and see more of the world. Have a question about travel, miles + points, or a specific destination? I'm always available to help! Seriously. I reply to every email and you can also reach me via DM.  

Come give Altitude a spin, I'd love to get your feedback and have you along for the ride!
Thanks, @ellenchisa - this means a lot coming from you! The member-first model is a huge component to Altitude and one that I hope to keep growing. ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è
@startupradius @paul_shuteyev cool! I‚Äôll DM you shortly!
@utsengar great question and thanks for the feedback ?! I'll work on adding a section to highlight the differences on the landing page.

With Altitude you are getting: 

<b>+ Personalization</b> You set airlines and airports you want to follow. This is means you will only see deals and prices that are relevant to your preferences.
<b>+ Immediate Alerts</b> (SMS and/or email)
<b>+ Wider Deal Coverage</b> Altitude is using both automation + human curation to analyze tons of flight routes daily. This means you will get more deals sent to you.
<b>+ Deal Archive/History</b> If you're wondering how a current flight price compares to historical deals, you can run a quick search.
<b>+ Travel Tips and Resources</b> I'm actively building out the content side to Altitude that includes regular blog posts and travel-related tutorials. If you have specific questions, rest assured I'll be there to get you an answer.
<b>+ Member voices matter</b> I'm 100% open to ideas and feedback. If there is something else that you would like to see, I'm all ears and will do my best to make it happen.

‚úàÔ∏è
@utsengar One more (important!) thing I forgot to add. 

Altitude covers both international + domestic flight deals departing from the USA. I think this is important since not everyone is interested in taking a long international vacation. Short trips within the US can be just as fun and interesting!

Hi everyone!‚Ä®‚Ä®

?‚Äç? I‚Äôm the creator of <a href=""https://womenmake.com"">Women Make</a>, an open community I made so women can have a place to find support in the maker space. But Women Make is more than that. With this community, I also want to <b>put women at the forefront</b> by highlighting their stories and promoting their work in ways that don‚Äôt always happen in a male-dominated field.‚Ä®‚Ä®

‚ö°Ô∏è Last October I organized the <a href=""https://womenmake.com/just-ship-it-october-2018"">Women Made 30 Day Challenge</a> and also participated in it. The goal was simple: we had <b>30 days to build and launch something</b>. We did this as a supportive community, meaning we built our products together, helping each other. I thought it was the perfect opportunity to develop a podcast. I shared what it‚Äôs been for me to start such a project in a <a href=""https://twomakers.io/how-i-overcame-my-fears-for-a-cause-i-deeply-care-about/"">blog post</a>.‚Ä®‚Ä®

? Two things I noticed that inspired the project:‚Ä®
- There is a <b>lack of diversity</b> in the role models we can see in the maker and entrepreneur community‚Ä®
- From my experience with Women Make, sometimes women just need <b>a little push</b> to gain more self-confidence and start making/launching‚Ä®‚Ä®

? I think a podcast is a great medium to <b>shine a light on women</b> and highlight more role models for us. It is a great way to <b>put a voice to the stories of women like us</b>, who started an entrepreneurial journey, and make it more personal. I think there is no better encouragement. Finally this podcast is not bounded to our community but intended for all the women entrepreneurs in general.‚Ä®‚Ä®

? Today I‚Äôm very excited to launch the <a href=""https://womenmake.com/podcast"">Women Make Podcast</a> and reveal the first episode, which stars <b><a href=""https://twitter.com/katekendall"">Kate Kendall</b></a>. I couldn‚Äôt have dreamt of a better guest to start with! As the <b>CEO of CloudPeeps and The Fetch</b>, Kate has a lot of experience she kindly shared in this episode AND she‚Äôs also really charismatic.‚Ä®‚Ä®

? Thanks a lot to @katekendall for accepting to being my first guest, @tcodinat for the awesome GIF she made me for the launch, <a href=""https://twitter.com/internetVin"">Internet Vin</a> for his music I‚Äôm using in this podcast, @bentossell for hosting the 30 Day Challenge which led to this podcast among other things, and the support of the Women Make community of course!

I'm Rik, in March this year I launched <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/filepond-js"">FilePond.js</a> an open source file upload library ?

Doka.js was initially going to be a plugin for FilePond, but as the project grew I figured it would work better as a stand-alone solution. So here we are!

Doka.js features everything you need to handle image cropping on your website. <b>Turning</b>, <b>rotating</b>, <b>flipping</b>, setting a fixed or free <b>aspect ratio</b>, <b>client-side transforming</b> of raster images (and SVG's), mobile <b>photo orientation correction</b>, loading from various file origins, rendering fullscreen, in a container, and editing images in-place. ?

As Doka.js is a vanilla JavaScript solution and features a straight-forward file-in ? file-out API it easily integrates with existing platforms and libraries. To lower the bar even further the package contains helper functions and examples for linking with <b>Dropzone</b>, <b>Uppy</b>, <b>jQuery File Upload</b>, and of course <b>FilePond</b>. ?

Doka.js is named after the Dutch short word for ""Donkere kamer"" which stands for ""photography Darkroom"", so, now you know. With my Dutch roots, that seemed fitting. ?

That's it for now! I'm going to grab a ‚òïÔ∏è and will be here all day to answer your questions.
@danielkempe Hi! 

Style customizations can be made with CSS:
https://pqina.nl/doka/docs/patterns/api/style/

Functionality wise I'm exposing a way to add plugins in the near future.
@danielkempe You can integrate with the unsplash API for retrieving images I think, and you could use an upload library for pushing files to unsplash.

Text overlays are currently not part of the product but are on the roadmap. You could, for instance, add them in a second image editing step.
@nicolasmoinard Thanks!
@bjohn Thanks for the feedback Janez! Pricing is often a subject of discussion.

I've thought about pricing a lot. I feel it's important my customers purchase a product that functions and continues functioning into the future, you purchase a guarantee that if it doesn't function I will help you out. You're paying for continuous personal support and updates. The goal is to create an environment in which I can keep building and extending the product without running out of funds, I think this is in the customers best interest.
@imac2 Thanks @imac2 !
@justinotherjohnson, to be honest, I haven't tested it yet but as those often run on WebKit based engines I don't see why it shouldn't. So Electron and Cordova are fair game.

@chrisrxth @scottsilvi The context for the high rate is whether it's above or below the expected market rate for _that skill_. I've thought about switching it to something less blunt, like a distribution graph, so people can actually get an idea of how it fits in the market and then make their own call on whether it's ""low"", ""medium"" or ""high""... but I need to give that some more thought.

Re: rates - I agree with you in the context of employees, but I think this is different for contractors. Companies hiring contractors are already prepared to pay the money, and are more motivated by finding someone good, fast.

Hello fellow Product Hunters (& makers),

I am super excited to tell you about Random Hunt, my 5th (actually 6th outside of Product Hunt) product this year. The idea came shortly after the release of <a href=""https://exposure.cards"">exposure.cards</a>, which is a platform I created to find random underrated content from the Internet. Needless to say, I felt that the discovery system in Product Hunt was a bit limited, since although products get great exposure on their launch, they disappear the day after, never to be seen again. That's why I decided to change that, and give it a spin.

<b>? Building Random Hunt</b>

I begun working on Random Hunt very early on, around August, when I made several UI mockups of what I felt the platform would be like. I envisioned a minimal light website that displayed 3 products and multiple makers on the press of a button, but something just didn't feel right.

I abandoned the project temporarily to focus on <a href=""https://twiverse.com"">Twiverse</a>, being a product which a much larger scope and potential, but after launching it just a few days ago, I decided to give it another try, and I gave it a change of look. The website is dark and full of playful animations, colours and gradients, definitely not like the original flat design. I posted about it on <a href=""https://twitter.com/tcodinat/status/1067485013858574341"">Twitter</a>, and here's one of the images of my canvas in Figma, with muliple iterations of the product.

https://i.imgur.com/jxNjgBq.png

In terms of the development, I used ReactJs for the third time this year in my products because of the kind of application I was building, and to make it more understandable & cleaner when sharing it publicly in GitHub.

<b>? Launching, and some of my goals</b>

In order to prepare for the launch, I worked on a video just like for Twiverse, as I felt it made the product more attractive and memorable. While that did postpone my launch, I still think it was the right decision. I also wanted to take the opportunity of launching in Product Hunt to grow my audience, traffic and possibly my revenue ? so I added a header linking to my old platform <a href=""https://exposure.cards"">exposure.cards</a> & created an extra product called ""Ultimate Launch Kit"", offering my services to have a custom GIF thumbnail, media, copywriting & other work done for launching a product on Product Hunt.

Being on a personal challenge to launch as many products as possible this year, to gain experience and to attempt being nominated for a golden kitty award ? (unlikely seeing what others have done so far, soo impressive!), I decided to work on Random Hunt instead of another bigger project to be able to try hitting the 7 products mark by the end of 2018. I also wanted to have more open source projects, as I've seen that they've helped me get several job offers, surprisingly, and that people still do ask me for more.

Hope you like the product! Feel free to give feedback, I highly appreciate it. Thanks! ??
@frcbls Thank you so much!
@deadcoder0904 Thank you so much! Yes, I believe this will be super helpful to increase discoverability & getting more attention to old products ?

Matt from Snappr here. We launched YCDB 1.0 just over a year ago and were so happy with how much the PH community enjoyed it. So we kept working on it as a side project, rebuilding it from scratch with a totally new tech stack and the addition of many of the features that were suggested by the Product Hunt community last year.

It is still the most comprehensive, up-to-date public dataset on YC companies, but we hope this new version is a much more useful tool!

For those following at home, here's what's new:
- The metrics we track on each company has gone from 6 to 14.
- You can now create your own custom scoring to rank companies.
- Cool new metrics charting tools.
- Snappy new search with Algolia.
- Visual comparison of YC batches by funding and fate.
- Instant company table filtering and search.
- See what a company's website looked like at the time of their YC demo day.
- Companies from the most recent batch have been added.
- Our stack is now Node+Express with Handlebars and a Postgres DB.
- It is now hosted at ycdb.co instead of on snappr.co.
- Plus much more that you'll have to discover for yourself :)

Thanks to those hunters who suggested features and changes: @nathan_milham @rrhoover @kushagrpathak @fan_andy @guillaume_ @rafyasarmatta @paulsputer

We want to keep making YCDB even better, so please keep the feature suggestions coming ?
@_fones thanks for spotting this bug! (We introduced it at the last minute by putting YCDB behind a new CDN). It should be fixed now ?
@dhulser you can see the HQ location for most companies (our best guess based on the available data) by going to individual company pages, e.g. https://www.ycdb.co/company/snappr (in the right panel under 'Details'). It would be cool to add aggregate pages in future (e.g. all companies from location X in a list).

Another cool resource is YC World, which shows where founders came from as opposed to current HQ location: http://world.ycombinator.com/
@rrhoover Product Hunt also took out the #1 spot for fastest growing... https://www.ycdb.co/top-companies/growth-score ? 

One of bigger surprises things was that the 'survival rate' (non-dead status) of YC companies after 5 years is really high, much higher than startups generally (check out the chart on the homepage).

Also, although it shouldn't be so surprising, the charting tool really highlighted how just how dramatic the 'power law' is for YC companies - we had to apply log scales to the data to even be able to see most of the metrics ? e.g. https://www.ycdb.co/comparison-chart/funding/employees
Thanks @sferik ? I like love the idea of segmenting the exits (could be quite sobering for us founders!) Because we already have funding data in YCDB, we could just apply the test of ""is exit value greater than funding amount"" to do a rough cut along the lines you suggested. As for time spent on YCDB, it is roughly proportional to the amount of awareness it generates for Snappr, and the bulk of it was me on my Sunday afternoons ?

@ken_truong Thanks! Not sure to what graphics you are referring to, is it the window you see in some photos? That is from MacOS when you make a screenshot to capture a selected window.
@ken_truong no worries, I think you are talking about the illustrations. Indeed, those are very cool, they are free and Open Source, made by unDraw. Here you can find the list with all the resources we used in the Design Blocks: https://www.froala.com/design-blocks/designers
@blossomshirts Thanks. We have building tool to help people use the Design Blocks faster and then download the HTML. It doesn't have very advanced features yet, but we're getting there.

Here is the builder I am talking about: https://www.froala.com/design-blocks/webpage-builder. It has 2 modes, one is the mode where you browse and combine blocks and in the other one you can editor the content on the newly created page. To switch between these modes you can use the buttons from the bottom left corner.
@mrdobelina It's fixed now. Thanks for letting us know!";3;-4;True;True;False;community

This is my first time launching on Product Hunt! I‚Äôm excited to share Diversify Tech with the community.

Diversify Tech is for people like me who are underrepresented in tech. It is also for all of us in the tech industry who want to make it a welcoming and inclusive place.

?The idea sparked when I went to a conference on a scholarship this year. I met so many like minded people and learned so much. I wanted others like me to have the same opportunity. 

There are so many resources and opportunities like this but they are shared within closed networks. People who are not already part of a certain network may never hear about them. I want to put them out in the open so that they are easier to find.

‚ö°Ô∏èI started with a simple list of <a href=""https://twitter.com/venikunche/status/1004060214029582336"">tech conference scholarships </a> in June. Since then I shared over 150 scholarships.

? In October, when @marie_dm_ of Women Make organized the <i>Just f*ing ship it in 30 days challenge</i>, I took the opportunity to grow the site further. 

Now, underrepresented people in tech can
- Find scholarships to <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/tech-conference-scholarships"">tech conferences</a> & <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/education-scholarships"">bootcamps</a>
- Find resources that <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/speaking"">help them speak at events </a>&
- Join the <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/changetheratio"">#ChangeTheRatio campaign</a> to be featured if they are looking for a job

Employers can
- Share <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/job-board"">their jobs</a> and talk about their efforts in diversity and inclusion 
- Find <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/changetheratio"">people who are looking for jobs</a> &
- Find resources to help them hire diverse candidates

Tech Conference Organizers can
- Find <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/speaking"">diverse speakers</a> to speak at their events &
- Share <a href=""https://www.diversifytech.co/tech-conference-scholarships"">scholarships</a> and discounts to their events

Allies can
- Offer discounts on their products &
- Refer employers to post jobs and find potential candidates

I‚Äôm just getting started and I‚Äôm excited to see where this leads.

? Thank you to @geschehaas of Dreamers // Doers, @mijustin of Mega Makers, @marie_dm_ of Women Make and the Women Who Code DC community for being amazing and providing so much support. Thank you to @tcodinat for the awesome gif and video. 

Thank you to @patio11 who pointed me in the right direction and advised me to focus on increasing diversity in tech. We met only for 30 minutes but you had an impact ?

A huge thank you to @robwalling & @singlefounder for offering scholarships to MicroConf and @citadelgrad for being a great ally and sponsoring my ticket of the conference this year. You all sparked this idea.

Finally, thank you PH for reading and I welcome your feedback.

Hi everyone! I‚Äôm Lior, the founder of Darkness.
Darkness is a browser extension that provides beautiful dark themes for popular websites such as Google and Facebook.
Aside from looking cool, dark themes have real benefits: reducing eye strain and fatigue, eliminating glare at night, and improving sleep quality.

Today we‚Äôre glad to introduce Darkness v2, which takes dark themes to the next level:
‚úî Support for over 20 websites: YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Photos, Twitter, Facebook Messenger, Google Keep, Google Calendar, Reddit, Dropbox, GitHub, Trello, StackOverflow, Inbox and others
‚úî 7 different dark color themes to choose from: Iceberg, Tomorrow, Material Design, Dusk, Red Alert, Coffee, and The Matrix
‚úî New simplified user-interface
‚úî Firefox add-on (in addition to the Chrome extension)

Darkness comes in 2 flavors which you may choose from:
1. Darkness open source - self-hosted. All functionality, websites and skins are 100% free to use, pull requests are welcome! https://github.com/liorgrossman/darkness

2. Darkness freemium - downloadable from Chrome or Firefox stores:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/darkness-beautiful-dark-t/imilbobhamcfahccagbncamhpnbkaenm
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkness-dark-themes/
This free version offers a dark theme for Google and Facebook for free. By upgrading to Pro (one time $5 payment via PayPal) you can enjoy 7 skins on all 20+ supported website. Obviously, Darkness lets you try those skins before upgrading.

We‚Äôve reached over 100K users with Darkness v1, I can‚Äôt wait to see how far we get with Darkness v2.
Give it a try and let me know what you think, I‚Äôd be happy to answer your questions.

Cheers,
Lior
@mukilan Thank you!
Indeed, dark themes are great for prolonged period of reading (and writing)
@mukilan I don't have qualitative figures since we are not collecting user data :)
However, based on talking to hundreds of users, I can say the majority of Darkness users are in the tech community. Could be developers, product managers, designers, marketers, etc.  Some are not from the tech industry but are knowledge workers, such as lawyer or academics. All of the above are people who spend significant amount of time in front of a computer screen.

We also have quite a few users which are visually impaired users, from which I learn that the increased contrast of the dark theme helps.
People working late at night (either night shift workers, or just night owl freelancers) who find dark themes more suitable than an annoying bright glare.
We're also got a few senior and elderly users.

Overall, if I had to guess, I'd say about 60% of our 120,000 users are from the tech industry, 20% are knowledge workers not from the tech industry, and 20% are casual users or people who use it to aid with visual impairment.
Hi @mickc79, Darkness doesn't cover all bases either.
I believe there's a trade-off between supporting all websites, aesthetics, and performance.
Some extensions aim to darken all websites, which is great by itself, but unfortunately ""automatic"" dark theming which work by inverting and manipulating the colors on the screen often provides weird colors which is not aesthetic. Sometimes, when the algorithm needs to handle thousands of elements on the screen, it comes with a cost in terms of performance (pages could load and react slowly).
Darkness takes the opposite approach - instead of ""automatically"" darkening every website, it provides dark themes made and applied specifically for each website. The result is more intentional, and it also means that you can choose from various themes (Iceberg, Matrix green, Red alert), and there is no performance hit. We've been able to support about 25 websites so far: Google, Facebook, YouTube, Gmail, Google Drive, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook Messenger, Google Photos, Inbox, Dropbox, Keep, Google Calendar, GitHub, Trello, StackOverflow, etc. but unfortunately, not all websites are supported.
So yeah, it's a trade-off between supporting more websites on the one hand, and providing better aesthetics and performance on the other hand. We choose the latter option
@ignaty Thanks for the feedback.
I was looking for a single payment solution (to keep it simple) that would be acceptable by the widest number of extension users.
Many people don't feel safe enough to provide their credit card number to a browser extension, so I figured PayPal might mitigate that risk. It's widespread, globally recognized, and typically used by other extensions.
@ignaty Also, why can't you pay?
Even if you don't have a PayPal account, you can just enter your Visa/Mastercard number in the checkout screen and still be able to pay. Am I missing something?
@joshuapinter Yep. Seems like many website don't want the hassle of having to deal with more than one color scheme. It does make sense to me, as this could increase the time to develop (and test) each new component or feature added to the website.
One of the reasons we made Darkness open source is to allow designers and developers to easily create a skin for their favorite website. We built all the boilerplate so building a new skin is as easy as possible.
Re detecting macOS Dark Mode - that's a wonderful idea! Need to figure out how to do it.
@fotiskarioris Thanks Fotis!
Agreed, Slack is definitely one of the next websites we should work on (already has Gmail, Inbox, Messenger support, so Slack would make a lot of sense).
@mickc79 Yep, new sites are added regularly. 
Currently, our most popular dark theme is available for free for Facebook and Google. We might expand that as Darkness grows.
Packs are actually an interesting idea! Never thought of that, thanks!
@mickc79 Safari support is not planned at the moment, sorry. 
Initially we only had a Chrome extension, then based on popular demand we've ported it to Firefox.
I assume if there will be enough demand, we'll port it to Safari too, but we haven't got many requests for that so far.
@fajarsiddiq thanks for the feedback.

@itstheandre Hi Andre! The business model is similar (we love Lambda!) in that we invest in our students, train and coach them for free, and only get paid if they get a job. The difference is we take a fraction of tuition once hired: similar coding bootcamps take 17% of 3 yrs of income, and we take 10% of first year income. Hope that helps!
@itstheandre We differentiate with our live, interactive classes, coaching and training, so for now, yes, it's limited to those who can make class (5-8pm PST). We'll definitely be expanding availability and options!
@ihecci Thank you Ihecci! ?
@abadesi Hi Abadesi, great questions! I'll answer each of them seperately below  ? 

We've found success in high-paying roles like sales and business development correlates less with advanced degrees, and more with skills/superpowers you already have, like conscientiousness, curiosity, coachability, and emotional intelligence. Our application process (a short 10-minute form, and a live, personal video chat with our team) looks for these skills, rather than any education or age requirements. In fact, we welcome learners from non-traditional backgrounds - it's at the core of our mission.
@abadesi We spend the last third of our course actively preparing students for the job process. Students start mastering the products of hiring companies, and we provide interview prep and coaching, along with resume feedback. We connect students that are ready for a job with breakout tech companies who share our values of creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. As companies struggle to predictably hire top, diverse sales talent, and our graduates are fully ramped ~3 weeks into the job vs avg. of 3mo, they may compensate us for the placement, like other recruiting firms they work with.
@abadesi We also provide post-hire support for our hired graduates - we've found that this is a huge area overlooked by many of these programs. Having mentors available to help navigate the first few months of a life-changing job opportunity can make a huge difference.
@rrhoover It's crazy! As an industry, we focus most of our energy on teaching people to code. Yet, in a recent poll of 250 US college and university officials, not one school offered coursework in tools like Salesforce and Outreach. Meanwhile, the best sales reps are amongst the highest earners in tech. ??
@rajhathi Thank you for the support!! ?
@jmbailon Really appreciate it @jmbailon ! @kschuur is a force who's not only the best at what she does, but brings compassion to sales. It's so easy to overlook how important this is to humanize tech, and also move consumer behaviors.
@itstheandre For now, our classes are live at 5-8pm PST. We will be opening up to Europe in the future, but if you can make those hours today, then you're in ?
@fernandotherojo Thank you! Our goal is to build relationships with top hiring partners who share our values of diversity and inclusion, and do exactly that. We provide not only interview coaching and prep, but also resume review, and perhaps most importantly, training on company products before hired. We have an awesome list of top tech companies that's growing weekly, and we are grateful and humbled by the support in the community!
@timur_meyster Thanks for the love, Timur! ?
@wu_richard We really appreciate it @wu_richard ! Many high potential candidates in these roles are often overlooked because they come from non-traditional backgrounds. We want to fix this!
@sarahclarks you're amazing ? thank you for your support. This is a long fight with lots of hard work to do. The constellation of success stories in tech is what keeps us going ?
@ashwin_cheriyan1 ? We are fortunate to be learning from awesome people like you, every day.
@abadesi Yes - that's the goal over time, to shift costs away from students and to employers.  We enable tech companies to predictably hire top, diverse sales talent that is 90% ramped and ready to sell on day 1 - saving employers massive amounts of time and $. We fund a high-quality, fully-immersive education upfront, and students pay $0 until hired, to align our incentives, and select for students who are committed to learning. Our hope is this becomes close to $0 forever. We only want to be rewareded if we create real change.
@fernandotherojo Absolutely. Part of what we're doing is starting a conversation around skills-oriented hiring, instead of degree-oriented hiring. So many highly qualified candidates are overlooked because HR Applicant Tracking Software (ATS) screens for keywords like ""Salesforce"" and ""Business Development."" We want to provide both education AND access to underserved jobseekers.

Since I was finding Facebook browsing very boring and unproductive, I looked for something else more interesting and I found the trending section of Github.
I enjoyed using it a lot until I realized that Github Trending was showing no more than 25 results every day (and it's often the same from one day to another) and this is not enough to keep browsing and replace Facebook!
That is why I decided to build GitNews, to gather trending repositories from different sources, such as HackerNews, Reddit and Github (and more in the future), and provide an engaging infinite scrolling.

I also used this idea to learn NativeScript VueJS (an awesome framework by the way) -  @igor_randj amazing job thanks - and here you can find how: https://medium.com/learning-lab/lessons-learned-on-writing-apps-with-nativescript-vuejs-bd6a3066f0cb

GitNews is not perfect so all the feedbacks are welcome to improve it ?
@sarada_sagadevin Thanks a lot!
@paschalis_tsolakidis Thanks, glad you like it!
@kerembakiri Thanks, let me know if you have improvements ideas
@patricia_mayo1 Thanks a lot!
As concern the next sources I was thinking about product hunt.
I think NativeScript Vue is very cool mostly because I can keep the component based architecture of VueJS and use the Vuex architecture. Then to build it for both OS is a bit more tricky because you need to be sure that one change will not mess in the other OS. Nevertheless NativeScript has a cloud deployement feature that let's you build for iOS without having a macbook and this is pretty amazing!

141613;YourNote;1.0;4;Yes;149;20/12/2018;20/12/2018 00:37:00;Thursday;Yes;No;No;"YourNote is a note-taking app that put user's first. With YourNote, your notes are -

The maker of YourNote here. YourNote is a user-first note-taking app. By user-first, we mean that user's personal data (which are the notes) are guaranteed to be secure and private if you use YourNote (not like Facebook ?). This is achieved by using Blockstack and Gaia for user authentication and user data storage. So, at any point in time, user and only the user has access to their notes. Even if their Gaia storage gets hijacked, their data is encrypted using the keys only the user holds so it's basically impossible to access a user's data for a third party. This establishes two things.

1. ? Data Security
2. ? Data Privacy

So with YourNote and Blockstack, we can be sure that we are good on those fronts. Another thing that makes YourNote interesting is that it uses open standard (markdown with frontmatter) for storing notes. So even if YourNote gets taken down, the user can still access their data using any text editor as the data is stored on their own storage. Also, if the user doesn‚Äôt want to use YourNote for some reason, they can export their data and either use a text editor for accessing them, or fork YourNote and make their own app. So basically, another thing that YourNote guarantees is -

3. ? Data Accessibility

I believe these three things are very important for a note-taking app which stores data that is more ""personal"" and ""valuable"" to the user than photos, media, and other data.

What do you think?
@daidardi It's free, at least for now. I have mentioned it in the FAQ section of the website.

We‚Äôve received a great support 4 month ago, when we were hunted with our first app Social Proof - https://www.producthunt.com/posts/hoversignal

That gave us a huge boost in motivation and today we are happy to announce our major update: the new Lucky Lottery app. It‚Äôs a fun game aimed to increase your conversion and add some fun to the purchasing process. 

We believe that gamification is a key to success in 2018, not only in online sales, but in many other industries. Public speaking, teaching and learning are much more successful when they have gamification elements. 

The concept is simple: user gets a lottery ticket with scratch-off sections and is encouraged to exchange his email address for possibilities to win prizes. The best part: it doesn't feel forced, he will do this by himself to get closer to the desired prize. 

We believe that this service will help you boost your sales before Christmas!

I'm Jesper and I'm the creator of Namekin. The idea for Namekin came about when my wife and I were chatting about how awkward it is that everyone in our respective families has inconsistent email addresses at all these different providers - why can't we just email mom@ourfamily.com and be done with it? From there, the rest of the features blossomed out as we brainstormed other things that we thought would be useful, and sure enough - they were. Important date reminders and the family mailing list, in particular, have been killer features for us as we've been dogfooding Namekin, and now I'd love to have you join as well.

-->Hey everyone!!! I'm Ethan ‚Äì maker of <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kanbanmail"">KanbanMail</a>, <a href=""https://codetheweb.blog"">Code The Web</a>, <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/maker-rocks"">Maker.rocks</a> and now Makerlog Menubar!!

Makerlog Menubar is a super fast way to log your tasks to <a href=""https://getmakerlog.com"">Makerlog</a>, right from your menubar ?

<b>? What is Makerlog?</b>
Makerlog is an awesome platform by @ftxrc where you can log your tasks openly and transparently! For example, <a href=""https://getmakerlog.com/@Booligoosh"">here's my profile</a>. If you don't have an account you can sign up, it's free! Then start logging tasks straight from your menubar by downloading Makerlog Menubar ?

<b>?‚Äç? Why I made this</b>
I really love transparency, I'm not sure why anyone wouldn't do everything transparently by now. It increases your following, visitors and user count. I log every single task I complete every day on Makerlog, in fact I currently have a 141 day streak! I wanted it to be even easier to log my tasks to Makerlog, so I would never put if off for forget. So I created Makerlog Menubar! Now I can log my tasks with just a few keypresses ?

<u><i><b>Here are some cool features:</b></i></u>

<b>‚ö°Ô∏è Log from anywhere</b>
Just type Shift ‚åò M from anywhere on your computer to show/hide Makerlog Menubar! It‚Äôll give you a huge productivity boost ?

<img src=""https://menubar.getmakerlog.com/img/log-from-anywhere.gif"">

<b>? Attach images</b>
Simply drag any image straight onto the Makerlog Menubar app to attach it to your log! 

<img src=""https://menubar.getmakerlog.com/img/drag-attachments.gif"">

<b>? Dark mode</b>
Makerlog Menubar will automatically change between light and dark mode based on your operating system's settings!

<img src=""https://menubar.getmakerlog.com/img/darkmode-switching.gif"">

<b>? Hashtag autocomplete</b>
Makerlog Menubar suggests hashtags for you! When a suggestion appears, just press the right arrow key to accept it. If there are multiple matching hashtags, it calculates the most relevant one based on your previous hashtag usage.

I have some few simple questions to you: Do you know how much time are you spending on your computer or in a specific application during your day-to-day? I guess not.

As a freelancer, a task so easy was one of my biggest problems: know exactly what I've done throughout the day. After trying and even paying some ""time trackers"" and didn't having satisfactory results, I'm planning to build a perfect and functional automatic time tracking.

cTimer App will be a daily and weekly application reporter for Mac and Windows able to deliver you a complete log of all work and task done on your computer and understand better and in detail how and what are you spending your time with.

If you are interested and want to know more about the project, you could watch the video:
https://youtu.be/K4CclS1QR50

Soon we will be launching the cTimer App project on Kickstarter, you could support us over there ? 

cTimer Goals:
- Show how, when and what you have used your time with and how long have you been on your computer. It‚Äôs means, activities recorded in the fullest detail.
- Optimize and improve your time by using the logs result
- Make to be clear how long you been working to complete a task or project
- Get from the daily applications log a better understanding of how and what are you spending or using your time.

cTimer purpose:
- Develop to Mac and Windows
- Daily and Weekly activities report
- Weekly productivity graph report
- Functionality to Export your logs in .json or .csv

If we have good feedback from the project we plan to make more updates such as:
- Add personalized notes in each logged activity
- Delete any logged activity
- Project management (We would like to know from all of you if how prefer on web or desktop version?) which includes create, edit, update projects and add projects detailed as: Name, Client, Timeline, Budget and Project color.
- cTimer records the time of every app you have used and give you a complete activities report carried out throughout the day or week.

It works, except for one little quirk: react may complain that the pre-rendered html does not match html the user eventually sees in the browser, but other than this little warning, which I will try to fix over the next few days, it should be all good.
@michael_morrison2 I think the main value proposition is the seamless integration with my dashboard. It is entirely possible to do A/B testing using react-ab-test and integrate it with mixpanel or google analytics, and then create reports to make sense of the data. 
With this project however everything is already integrated, a non-technical person can create an A/B test, and copy/paste some code into a ticket for a developer, and wait for data to show up. I personally found this approach much easier.
@reepush thank you! I really appreciate the feedback. 

First, regarding the api, I think that for apps with a more complex architecture perhaps the context api would be more convenient, but I haven't given it that much thought. My api was inspired by a handful of existing react packages for ab testing. 

Regarding the tracking infrastructure, why would you prefer your own? How do you reuse it across projects? I personally found it very easy to add Lean Analytics into a new project. 

Finally, regarding WordPress, I can't speak to that, because I don't have any experience with that platform. But I would imagine there be a plug-in for that. 

Great questions! There is definitely some room for improvement on the API side.
@reepush you bring up some great points, here is what I think:

> api

It is just rendering and tracking. And the reason why not to do it manually is the same reason why you would import any other tiny package from npm. It's less code in your codebase, standardized api and patches.

> google analytics/own infrastructure

Google analytics is a great service. It's very easy to start with, but I find it difficult to set up custom reports, such as for ab testing. It's packed with functionality, and sometimes I feel like I need training just to make sense of it.

Not many people have their own tracking systems, primarily because it's a lot of work to build them properly. And I am not the one to say this, because I built this project, but it's almost always better to use an off the shelf solution when it comes to things not specific to your application.

> target audience

Primarily I built this service for my own use. As a developer/maker who often comes up with new projects, I find it valuable to have an a/b testing tool that is easy to use. So, I think the react devs/makers would find this service useful. 

As for non-tech people, they usually have tech people working for them. If I was a product owner on a software development team, I could set up an account on this service, define an a/b test, and hand off the code I get to my developers for integration. These developers don't even have to know what leananalytics.io is. So I think there is an opportunity here to serve non-technical product owners too.

I hope that answers your questions ?";4;-2;True;True;False;community

Research has shown that students achieve more in school when their parents are involved in their education. Parents are a cornerstone of educational success, and we need tools and policies that empower, inform and involve them.

The lack of funds is one of the biggest challenges for schools. Task-a-Thon's innovative task based micro-fundraising concept blends parental engagement, classroom development and school fundrasining seamlessly.

This is my first side project published on Producthunt, exciting times ? 

It was a lot of fun to develop and to learn Swift in the process. It took a lot of experimenting to come to a recording method that had minimum impact on battery but still offered enough quality to be actually meaningful.

DejaVideo has already saved my own butt several times in the past weeks and I hope it will also be useful to others!

For now I think it's mainly useful for QA'ers and developers to instantly have a reproduction for bugs, but there might be completely other use-cases too ? 

It still only has the bare minimum features, curious to also hear about what you would like to see added!
@gioismeyo Thanks for trying out and giving your feedback!

It should only flash when you connect/ disconnect a screen and on start up of the application (to indicate which screen it is recording from that moment on).

The animation also briefly shows up while the last minute is being exported when you press the export button.

If it does it more often, it's a bug ? 

Perhaps the animation is also a bit too much at the moment, had too much fun with it, will minimise it in later versions. Thanks again!

I've been living in Asia and working in tech for the last 17 years of my life. I created Tech Jobs Asia for a few reasons:

1. In my last role where I was a hiring manager, I found it very hard to fill tech roles. Tech talent is super scarce in Asia and hiring managers need better ways to connect directly with tech candidates.
2. When I left my last job I felt like picking up some contract work in my framework of choice, but I was shocked to find there was no easy way to find ""Rails jobs in Asia"" besides doing a bunch of Google searches.
3. Tech talent is so scarce in Asia that we need to import more talent and make Asia an appealing place for foreign tech talent to come and work.

In this MVP of the site, I fell a bit short of my ambition for (3). I wanted a site that shows the best tech opportunities in Asia along side lifestyle content showing what a great place Asia is to work - but ran out of time (this MVP took 1 month). Definitely something to work on for a follow up release!
@olivalcf the focus for now is on dev / programming related jobs in Asia, since these were the roles I had real difficulty in finding candidates for when I was a hiring manager.
@swsalim It's updated every day. Each job links to a unique job details page on a company's careers site. If that page disappears, the system considers the role filled and the job post will be deactivated.

Since writing about sound visualisation a few years ago (<a href=""http://graemefulton.com/projects/post/seeing-sounds-with-threejs"">e.g. see here</a>), I was always interested in seeing sounds, but didn't see any career-related reason to pursue the interest so I just stopped! :(

? I want to take this chance to encourage people to make time for what you're really interested in, as it's easy to think ""I'll learn about that awesome stuff later""/""that won't pay the bills"". But if you think like that, you might never get to do what you really like, and eventually that area of interest will be like a shadowy ghost of what could have been. 

This project is for me to start re-exploring sounds. Last year I became interested in the sounds on UI of apps, and got recorded a library, as there isn't really a place to find them all. Here is that library! 

Future todo:  replace the YouTube sound visualisations a Web Audio API version, and add content about this area to teach more about it.  That content will be premium to fund the site! That's the rough plan for this one.

Shoutouts to @dinuka_jayasuriya @tcodinat @kerrtrvs @vertis @pyyding who also launch products all today in <a href=""https://makerskitchen.xyz/"">makers kitchen</a> and <a href=""http://getmakerlog.com"">makerlog</a> haha!
@dinuka_jayasuriya haha yeah, definitely gonna add a games section - there are lots of recordings already on youtube so I would just add some playlists for those classics like Mario and Sonic :D
@fajarsiddiq thanks Fajar! I think so, especially sound as an alternative to screens - will be combining with some Voice UI stuff
@kerrtrvs Thanks Kerr) !
@fajarsiddiq wow thanks Fajar! I think it's quite unique too since I couldn't find another version out there for design
@yesnoornext yeah sound can be hugely influential! 

These are some great points Vincent, thank you! I will definitely be looking into something like creating packs or adding curated sound recommendations from 3rd parties to make them easier to find!

This will also provide an avenue for a premium service and keep things sustainable. That's something I'm focusing on in 2019!

Thank you for checking out Song Peel. In case you haven't seen our website already, Song Peel is an online vocal remover service. 

Earlier in 2018, a few audio geeks and I noticed that a lot of karaoke enthusiasts didn't have access to the instrumental versions of their favorite songs, therefore in aim to fill a need, Song Peel was born. We quickly realized that Song Peel not only helps karaoke professionals, but also musicians, DJs, and even video production artists.

The service is simple - you send us your song and in 24 hours or less, we will send back separate vocal and instrumental tracks of that song! The results are achieved by applying our in-house proprietary vocal remover method optimized to yield the highest quality fidelity possible.  

Our web service is only the beginning of Song Peel. We plan to create mobile apps, expand the features of our website to include fully automated tools for vocal removal, an online radio channel, and so much more! If you have any questions or feedback, please post a comment and I'll be happy to reply back to you. I'm looking forward to the road ahead. :)
@edmsauce Thank you! ?
@stars7up That is just the starting price, in the future, we may adjust our pricing model. If you buy the other bundles, the price per song drops. Thanks for your feedback. ?

Here's a mini side project I just made on the first day of this year, that I thought might be interesting for people here launching their own projects, and possibly thinking of selling them at some point.

? Problem
@andreyazimov just sold his side project MacBook Alarm: https://medium.com/@AndreyAzimov/the-crazy-story-of-how-my-first-mac-app-got-acquired-258bd03d8840

And we just had a big discussion about getting your projects acquired on Twitter: https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1078927182297063424.

For many it's unclear what their side projects are worth. Many want to sell, or have people interested in buying but have no idea how to get to a proper price. I definitely didn't.

?Solution
This calculator helps you figure out a base price to aim towards when negotiating selling your side project. Because not knowing what your product is worth puts you in a bad spot for negotiation!

This is just a start: I now base it on net income (revenue - costs), multipliers by industry (sales price being usually a multiplier of net income), and growth rate multipliers (higher growth increases sales price).

I'll keep adding more possible variable inputs and variations. 

If you have feedback or ideas, please let me know and I'll implement them ASAP. ?
@seymourgroup Thanks Graham! My name's not Lev, but I'll take it!
@seymourgroup HAHA got it
@chipdonglim Fixed!
@graeme_fulton Thanks Graeme. Surprisingly much less than me/you'd expect. Unless it's strong brands like Airbnb, Google and maybe even Lonely Planet, it doesn't have that much effect. A brand like Nomad List is strong in a niche, but not well known in mainstream. So realistically not that valuable.
@edgarascom potential value is hard to estimate, that's why M&A firms get paid so much ? 

Ways to measure potential value:
- traffic/users * price per view/user
- intellectual property * future usage

The potential value of IP is hard to measure because it's not clear if the market wants to pay for it and if it does, how much?
@rrhoover Awesome! Will add revenue per MAU input now too. Only question: how would it affect the revenue box above? As in, you enter your revenue already. Then you enter your MAU and MAU price. Should changing the MAU and MAU price affect the revenue box?

I'll also start slowly hiding the more advanced boxes under an ADVANCED button. Thanks :)
@ardalanme Thanks Ardalan for letting me know. I fixed this now. It was using traffic-based valuation at 0% and net income-based valuation at 10% and using the growth multiplier on the traffic valuation. I've disabled this now.";4;-3;True;True;False;creativity

It is my second project, named Maker Message. I was creating this to fulfill my needs as product maker, especially in the context of product updates announcement. 

I know there are products out there that has similar function, but I need simplicity, easy to setup, without domain and view limitation (it is very important because as a maker we will create not only one projects, but a lot). So I created one without those boundaries. Hope you found it useful.

I've been building this side project that if you're on Instagram you might have seen pop up in your feed over the last few days. I thought it'd be nice to share it with you all too. 

I'm a designer and technologist and often do experimental projects with data and image-making.

I thought it would be interesting to make a shareable visualization of your Instagram images throughout the year, starting with the question - is there a correlation between the colours you use in your images and how much they are liked by your followers?

I was also itching to learn a handful of new technologies, so this is the result.

Over the last couple of weeks my little side project has made about 300,000 reports, and it's just about held up to a couple of million page views in the process.

There's some interesting stuff under the hood here that I'm happy to share. React, serverless, a little bit of machine vision, GraphQL‚Ä¶ I've learnt a ton doing this!

Oh, and I'm British, hence the *correct* spelling of Colour in this project name ?

The data favors highly stable projects. When we gathered the data from project management tools our threshold for acceptance was based on projects that were flagged as completed. We found the average cost landing around $160-$180k. After adding in considerations for specialized features and infrastructure we seen that number climb.

All things considered we may make a freelancer mode to represent the cost basis for lower-end dev. The challenge is finding the data. In our research it's close to 88% non-completion rate.
@vishalkrsingh it would be awesome if you could share some of your data. this is a machine-learned data set that calculates these prices. In fact you can read how we calculated everything here: https://medium.com/@team_96861/how-much-does-uber-for-dogs-cost-39ad9b8471dc
@ayush_chandra Thanks! The machine learning algo did most of the work ?
@simgooder Thank you so much!!!

The data comes from 41 dev shops across the world. We extracted data from the project management tools to calculate everything. The most important thing was that the apps were completed. That was something that was rare to see. 

Often the apps would be good and lower price, however they would not be complete so we did not factor their data in.

We're always looking for data. So if you or any shop wants to share it would be great. It would improve the accuracy and become an even more useful resource for the community. 

Thanks again!
@ryanhickmam Thanks! 

The data comes from many agencies around the world. We actually export the data directly from project management tools of real projects.
@wesley_marshall  thanks!

???Having a moment ??? It would be cool to create a space for calculating how much it costs to REBUILD an app.
@kenny_quach Thanks! In my freelance days I commonly developed projects for clients that were similar to other popular apps. Far too many times I found myself doing more learning than earning because I was undercutting everyone...even myself. 

After working at a bigger agency and with larger companies I found how much apps really cost to be done the right way. Much of that is presented here in this tool.

Today I'm extremely excited to present you my baby/life work.

I wanted to be a better writer. I started with a simple habit: writing 200 words every day. 

I made <a href=""https://200wordsaday.com"">a community</a> out of this idea where people get into a writing habit and improve together. 

The challenge became a product I built during the Product Hunt Makers Festival 2018, which our new-born community won one month ago.

I have been writing for 60 days straight, and 200WaD has grown to be a fine community of 500 writers with 950 posts. 

Today I think it's time to open up. We want to reach new people willing to get into a writing habit and improve at it together. Writing is great for many reasons. It is fun. It is the most common form of business communication. It's great to keep your mental health as it clarifies the mind. All you have to do is to get started and write a bit every day. Anybody can be a writer now, 200 words at a time.

It doesn't matter how good or bad your English is. We believe in hard work and persistence. <a href=""https://200wordsaday.com/fellowship"">Join the fellowship and let's become great writers together!</a> :)

One reason why I didn't sign up is that 750 words is way too much when you are just getting started with developing a writing habit.

The other thing is that 200WaD is 100% open. You can read what the members decide to share publicly without being a member, and thus grow your own readership.

@moritzseyda Thank you! Glad to hear. They have a good and more mature product.

I like the way the usernames are mapped directly to your Instagram profile. There's a catch if you change your nick over there of course. But this way you can't steal Rihanna's chance of getting a matching many.link profile link ?
@vaibhavsisinty I've had some trouble with Twitter not wanting to link it as well. What browser are you using? It's not blocked in any of mine if I access it directly.
@vaibhavsisinty I wonder what has been going on on this domain ? off to the WaybackMachine!
@pregenun Thanks! Actually no. I'm planning on focussing my few efforts on targetting Instagram. Adding more sign-in services sound like a simple thing to do but conceptually the whole product explodes.
@vaibhavsisinty Hadn‚Äôt considered. Sounds like a fine idea. Utm sources too I guess.
@omarhashimoto There are a few more (some of them in the sidebar here on PH). I don't think you should be deterred. Plenty of room and Instagram users for everyone ?
@vladzima Thanks! What you're describing is out of scope of what I want this to do. Makes it something completely else. The problem with more services isn't a technical one. I suppose I could add Twitter auth in 15mins or so thanks to Rails and Omniauth.

But conceptually the product is instantly something completely different and I need to spread my already sparse efforts on supporting many platforms and cases instead of just this one.

I really feel like being solely Instagram focused is a feature and not something I need to ""fix"".
@herbosa Linktree is very similar, yes. I suppose the main differences are that they have more features and a paid version. Their profile administration tool and the profiles themselves also look and function differently than mine.
@samuelcouch Didn't know Hype Link. There are a bunch of these and they differ in subtle ways but the idea is essentially the same. I'd say pick the one that speaks to you the most ?

1. Battery
It's a problem and frankly, we are still working on this. The good thing is that for squats, you only need to open it for short periods of time. It's like a HIIT workout, you don't need to open it for 1 hour. 
2. Abuse
We developed human pose A.I. that detects your movements using your front facing camera. It uses 17 different points on your body to identify your squats and that makes it harder to cheat. Of course, there are still some edge cases but we believe our A.I. can solve those soon. As we get more data, the more we can identify the ""abuse cases"".
3. Privacy
Yes, you can turn off the camera upload in the settings. We will add more UI to alert and make sure this is happening in the next update.

I'm excited, mostly because we've seen 90 people contribute more than 140 posts so far!

@christopher_travers Hi Christopher, thanks for trying out the app! I initially chose to use Facebook login to simplify the signup/login process so people wouldn't have to make yet another account for an app that's meant to be quick and easy to use, but I do see your concern with it as well. Are you saying that it would be better to have other avenues of login like Google login, or to just add a traditional signup/login system altogether? Love the idea of having custom URLs ‚Äî¬†I see the potential for people adding things like resumes, cover letters, etc. Thanks again for the feedback ?
@anna_0x Hi Anna, there is a platform restriction at the moment, but I'm working on learning Android development and putting out an Android version. In the meantime, anybody can scan your pass, whether it be with an Android or iOS device, as the scan brings you to a website instead of populating the information within the app itself. You only need an iOS device to create the card and share them. Thanks for taking a look at the app!";3;-2;True;True;False;web development

I like the idea to make it difficult for the user to turn off any setting. Puzzle or maybe disable the filter only after a wait period - like 5 minutes or so; so that we don't fall victim to our habits and impulses and use these sites only for any productive reason.

You're right. Getting good at designing is a whole new area and needs more and more practice. Hope we'll get better at it someday ?

All the best with your side-projects. Keep Creating!!!

We're back with the much anticipated SilverSocks Crew. Keep your feet comfortable and clean all day long when you wear the ultra-clean SilverSocks.

Unlike other socks on the market that use silver ions, the SilverSocks use threaded silver and as a result, the silver doesn‚Äôt wash out meaning they perform better for longer. With the use of silver, the SilverSocks actually sterilize over 650 types of bacteria. Likewise, this eliminates odors to keep your feet smelling fresh. 

At the top is a gentle cuff to help promote circulation while the trapezium toes mean you can wear either sock on either foot. Thanks to breathable vents, SilverSocks also regulate heat. 

Finally, the reinforced heel and cushioned sole offer¬†all the comfort you need. In layman‚Äôs terms: your feet will be their absolute comfiest and freshest for the entire day. 

Available in three custom fit-like sizing, the SilverSocks also come in three stylish and modern colors.

Drop a comment if you have any questions.
@blakehendrix I am not familiar with the Y Socks but I can tell you that the SilverSocks are probably the most comfortable socks you'll ever wear. The Cotton or Merino paired with the Circulation Cuff make them extra comfy.
@brettvavra They're available in Blue, Black and Grey
@krystalcasey Glad you like it, I converted part of the video to a Gif.
@drewbowers It sounds like the product you're referring to uses Silver ions, SilverSocks use threaded silver and as a result, the silver doesn‚Äôt wash out.
@leighrobertson Please send us a message to support(at)beclothed.com and we can arrange something.
@leemacdonald2 Silver is used widely for killing bacteria so it was only right that we get rid of the bacteria on your feet with it
@bradfordholland1 A lot of jewelry is made from pure Silver as it is one of the safest elements for humans so you'll have no problem wearing them
@garryfisher Thanks Garry, we look forward to your thoughts on this version!

I‚Äôm Hamish, the maker of FeedZen. 

The idea for this app came from an existing chrome extension: News Feed Eradicator for Facebook. The thing I loved about NFE is that you can still access messaging, events, groups etc. Using it freed up loads of time but nothing existed for iPhones - so I made my own and extended it for other websites.

Before, visits to Facebook consisted of endless scrolling and refreshing - now, I can go in, do what needs to be done, and get out.

My productivity and mental wellbeing has improved as a result, and that‚Äôs exactly how I want my users to feel ? 

Get FeedZen for free now only on the Apple App Store.

DiffBot is focusing on helping users monitor what has changed on specific webpages. 
GetData.IO is focused on providing an abstracted semantic query language layer that documents data locked up within a single page or spread across multiple webpages.

We churned through a bunch of Database engines and after understanding deeply our user needs ended up caching the data using flat files instead.
@angeloe Hi Angelo, thanks for helping list GetData.IO on the Product Hunt. ?
@jordanslon Hi Jordan, the current URL for the chrome extension does not yet support the extraction of custom data types. However the required_attribute property within columns clause does allow you to do so.

This is the API
https://getdata.io/docs/semantic-query-language/api 

This is a sample data source that was created today 
https://getdata.io/data-sources/22688-vente-march%C3%A9-frais-tunisie-carrefour-tunisie#script
@vertis Hi Luke, yeah we are trying to find a good balance between promoting community sharing and generating enough revenue to cover for server cost, quite similar to the former GitHub model.
@jordanslon I will add it to the extension once I have figured out a good and simple UI/UX to expose that feature without bloating the current interface. I just noticed that you are a designer. Would be nice if I could get some inputs from you on any UI suggestions you might have. :)

Paul here, co-founder @ Listen

As podcast enthusiasts and designers, we set out to create the best possible podcast app. 

?‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è After countless interviews and reading through tons of online forums and comments, we were able to outline the core experience and the on-the-go context of podcast consumption. 

?‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We learned that podcasting is tapping into the last frontier of human attention: multi-tasking/on-the-go attention (70% are commuting). ? ? ? ? ‚õµÔ∏è

? This led us to a gesture-based UI which allows the user to perform all the essential functions with one hand. 

? When designing the app, we also prioritized the queue feature that allows you to easily add episodes into a dynamic list which you can easily access and rearrange. 

? ?‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lots of other cool stuff:
  - Easily import your library.
  - Discover new shows based on what‚Äôs trending or search for a topic. 
  - Your new episode feed allows you to sort and see progress for each episode.
  - Easily view the descriptions and decide if you want to add it to your queue or listen.
  - When listening, with one swipe, access your playlist and drag to rearrange.
  - Access previously listened to episodes.
  - Setup robust download and delete settings to keep your phone decluttered.

‚úîÔ∏è This app is free and there are no app ads. Ever. 

We wanted to give you something better and something the podcast industry deserves to have. Join us in the journey to make the best possible podcast experience.

Would deeply appreciate your thoughts and support on this! 

Yours truly, 

Paul
CEO & Cofounder of Listen App

@harryraymond I certainly don't want to demean and podcast apps because there are some good ones. But personally I didn't love any of them. As a designer, I didn't think any of them felt right in the context of a regular podcast listener on-the-go. Honestly, I designed it for myself first, then did a ton of research on how people listen to podcasts, and figured out what is important and what isn't. The goal is the create the best possible podcast app!

Appreciate the feedback!
@3raxton Thanks Braxton!

I've had it enabled for about a week on chrome and accidentally opened up a link on safari, the difference is overwhelming!
@tinustate Hey Tinus!

Let me explain a little further my reasons for building this extension.  

I have Adblock enabled and for some reason, I noticed ad's on Amazon were still showing up, almost anywhere they could jam them, under side bars, under descriptions, even on user review pages. These all seemed to coming straight from Amazon and only linking to more things on Amazon. Especially the home page, bombarding sliders promoting various Alexa devices and shows on Amazon Prime, all of which i'm not interested in! I thought to myself, I come to amazon, to find what I need, read user reviews and check out. So by getting rid of all of the things they try to up sell us on, the shopping process was actually quite simple and streamlined!

And as for the moral dilemma you mention, Iv'e always been skeptical of the ""Sponsored products"" that appear at the top of results. For this reason I've removed them, and I don't feel bad about it. I come to Amazon to find the products I'm looking for, not to have products that pay money to Amazon for promotion to be the first thing in my face. 

Ultimately I thought to myself what do I hope to achieve coming to buy something on amazon? I want to be able to find what I'm looking for with no bias!

Thank you for check it out!
@lemillensink @baidoct Also I'm currently in the process of adding other TLDs, I've added .de and will push the update soon, what other TLDs would you guys like included?
@minhlede See my response above, I've added support for .de, and will be pushing the update shortly!
@garett_dunn1 Couldn't agree more! The speed difference on desktop is significantly noticable when not loading in amazon's plugins, widgets and sliders, the same approach could be applied to lower end phones

@seb88 Not sure I follow...

First off, I've never come across your product, but what it claims to do similar things, although I just tried installing it and it doesn't seem to be doing anything different, everything looks the same and still has sponsored posts and ads.

And most importantly you seem to be associated with a marketing company (Esquire Marketing) and are collecting browsing data, not cool!

I agree with you that we have no fool proof way of knowing whether or not the reviews are legit but I‚Äôll take them over sponsored content that anyone can submit.

The whole point was to have people that are looking for a specific product / brand to be able to find them immediately without having to navigate past sponsored ads

@estebanrules Great point Damian! I also ‚ù§Ô∏èwiki's and there are a lot of good options out there.

What I think distinguishes You Need A Wiki from others is it's primary focus on Drive/Docs integration first. Docs is a powerful editor so I wanted to keep that and extend it for team wiki's.

Because of this integration you can do things like:
- Set up a wiki quickly with your existing Docs (no copy, pasting and reformatting)
- If your team already knows how to use Docs, they can start adding to the wiki straight away. Your team members don't have to learn how to edit a wiki in a new interface.
- All your changes are saved to Drive so if you change your mind down the track everything is stored there.

There are probably others but I think these are the biggest pros/distinguishers from other wiki's.
@thepatwalls Thanks so much Pat!
@estebanrules Sounds great, feel free to get in touch if you have further questions.

But you can share it with any future employer who can then see the reference. However, you can see the aggregate overall meta-stats about your references such as your average ratings on different skillsets etc This is also one of the biggest difference as compared to the LinkedIn recommendations where everything is public and optional (and hence the person giving the recommendation is forced to be glowingly cloy whereas in our approach you can be honest and straight-talking). In a way we have tried to replicate the referencing model that happens in the academia world which has been fairly successful.
@ramesh_radhakrishnan @jonathan_danemo Thanks Jonathan. Great feedback. You are absolutely right about the references being the last stage of the recruitment game. Which is precisely the fundamental aspect we want to change about hiring. Basically, the current problem statement is that there is a lack of trust between what a person says in a resume versus the reality when it comes to recruiters. So what we have done in refersense is created this concept of a 'Trusted Profile'. Essentially, it is validation of different sections of a resume by your references. That ensures that recruiters get to see (and shortlist) profiles that have been validated (rather than wasting their sparse time on unvalidated profiles). This is an article that i recently published around how the hiring process needs to be inverted to make it more efficient and less wasteful.

Great to be back here.

I'm so excited to launch this today ?! 

<b>The problem</b>

95% of all recruiters and hiring managers use LinkedIn to find candidates. Additionally, millions use their LinkedIn profiles to attract clients and prospects to their businesses. LinkedIn is more important than ever in building your personal brand and career.

However, most people don‚Äôt take advantage of LinkedIn. Most profiles on LinkedIn are vague and aren‚Äôt optimized for what they‚Äôre looking for. This makes your profile harder to find and results in you missing out on opportunities. I built this tool to change that - implement the feedback on your profile and you'll get more views by to your LinkedIn profile, by people that matter to you.

<b>The solution</b>

Upload your (or anyone‚Äôs) public LinkedIn profile in PDF using LinkedIn‚Äôs ‚ÄòSave to PDF‚Äô feature. The analyser will:

‚úÖ Review your LinkedIn profile against 50+ rules and criteria in seconds; you'll get feedback on each core component of your profile, including your headline, summary, work experience and more!

‚úÖ Give you specific, actionable feedback on how to improve your profile‚Äôs visibility and discoverability

‚úÖ Powered by AI and NLP, the tool grades each section of your profile

‚úÖ Analyze what keywords your LinkedIn profile ranks for. Optimize your profile accordingly.

‚úÖ LinkedIn networking templates to help you grow and cultivate your network

‚úÖ Help you achieve your career goals by generating more leads, opportunities and recruiter requests

<b>The story of v2</b>

Around mid-last year, I launched the v1 of <a href=""[https://www.producthunt.com/posts/linkedin-review-by-resume-worded](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/linkedin-review-by-resume-worded)"">LinkedIn Review</a>. At the time, it was very much a side project to my main product (Resume Worded). 

It got a good amount of traction, but more importantly, a ton of people not only commented on PH, but also emailed me personally about how it helped them become better at getting the most out of LinkedIn. 

Over the past several months, I spoke to a bunch of career coaches, users and my newsletter subs. Using their feedback (thank you again!), I went back to the drawing board and after what feels like 100 iterations later, the product was finally ready :)


<b>Here's what's new compared to v1</b>

? Totally redesigned experience from ground up - every single thing was designed from scratch

? 20+ new features, including keyword analysis to help you rank for the right terms you want to rank for and LinkedIn networking templates

? New checks - including analyzing your profile's language, tone, sentiment using nlp

? New examples - learn from top profiles

Try it for your own LinkedIn profile, or anyone else in your industry! You can ‚ÄòSave to PDF‚Äô any profile on LinkedIn and upload it to the tool. 

If you have any feedback, please let me know!

Rohan
@hovo_evans thanks Hovo! Let me know if you have any feedback
@okhlopkov Hey Daniel!  We considered was a 'Login with LinkedIn' button; however, the public profile that is returned from LinkedIn's API was limited and wasn't as complete as the PDF that you upload to get an analysis.

The PDF option seemed perfect. It is one extra 10-second step, but it allows people to upload not only their profile, but anyone else's in their industry, in case they wanted to compare their profiles.

We right now just support email, Gmail and FB to sign up, but can look to add other sign in methods if you need them!

Early on in my bootstrapping / side-project-gigs journey, I often had to spend a long amount of time figuring what can of service or tool to use for finishing a particular task. I often didn't even know what I'm looking for, either ‚Äì until I would run to some obscure form post or tutorial that would point me in the correct direction, and I'd think to myself ""oh so that's how people do this particular thing"".

Communities like Product Hunt and Indie Hackers were a great way to learn what other makers use, and the recent trend of curated lists are great references. But between outdated lists and poor presentation, I still felt like I could build something of my own.

Postmake is a project I've been building on and off for the past year, but since I haven't heard anything but positive feedback about the project, I decided to work on it a little more seriously. I decided to focus on monetization from the get-go by charging for submissions. This helps with a couple of things:

- The directory can be continuously maintained and improved upon
- Eliminating the noise ‚Äì only serious founders are willing to pay a price to get their projects or services listed
- Access to the directory and all its content remain free

I'm still improving on the directory and adding new tools to it, so any feedback would be appreciated! 

PS: As a thank you to the Product Hunt community, use the promo code ""PRODUCTHUNTROCKS"" to get 20% off new submissions. ?
@r44d Thanks for weighing in Raad.

I kept bouncing around the idea of charging for submissions when I first started working on this, but decided to stick with it. Other than helping support the project, the idea is to keep the directory up to a certain level of quality. Only serious founders / businesses would be willing to pay for access.

Sites like startup stash are curated lists, and even though you might make your submission there's no guarantee you'll be added. What I'm trying to build with Postmake, instead, is a directory of tools ‚Äì if submissions conform to some guidelines (as in actually a business tool, within an accepted category), it would be listed.

As for the price, I'm still paying with that, but frankly so far I didn't get any complaints about it being too high. The way I see it, if Postmake sends you 75 visitors a month, that's a CPC of $1.33, which isn't very bad. And that's only for one month ‚Äì listings are permanent for this one-time fee.

I hope that made sense!";4;-2;True;True;False;creativity

These screenshots are from my account with my husband so the whole ""happy wife"" thing is more of an inside joke for us. Maybe I did not clearly define the goal of the app, it in no way says ""do this for me and get sex."" If the screenshots display that then I want to make it clear, again, that those screenshots are specifically for me and my husband. Now I know it seems like common sense to meet eachother's needs, I feel the same way. In theory, people in relationships would automatically do this. But in reality, that may not always be the case. Sometimes we simply forget to meet our partners needs! My husband, for example, could never remember to clean the floors for me. I would remind him over and over (nagging) and he still would just forget. It's just part of being human. Nobody is perfect, and no relationship is entirely perfect. But thank you for your two cents!
@andreasduess I think you are taking my screenshots from my own account too literal, which is my fault for posting these. But in no way am I stating that using sex as a way to get what you want is the way to go. The app promotes cooking, cleaning, date night, surprises, and intimacy, all different tasks that are important in any relationship. I am sorry that you feel it is a manipulation tool. I personally do not see how meeting your partners needs in part of manipulation, and I do not see how this is stereotyping at all. The shots are my own personal account with my husband and this is what works for us. I don't think you should look that deeply into it by claiming it promotes some sort of manipulation or stereotype. I do appreciate your honesty, though!
@anna_0x I see how you think it is a task manager app, but it is more than just reminding each other to do a few things for them. It specifically includes date night, cooking, cleaning, surprises, and intimacy, all factors that are specific to relationships. Have you heard of the 5 Love Languages? They are very similar to those, and this helps to remind that we need to meet our partners needs to ensure that their ""love tank"" is filled. The rewards, which I do believe should probably be renamed, are given to show a partner that they're also going to have their love tank filled by completing the task. Example, my husband HATES cleaning (which is a need of mine) the floors, but if he knows that I will take us out on a date night (his need) for cleaning for me, we both win! Relationships are a cycle of meeting each others needs to ensure harmony. Without the reward system, it could turn into ""clean the floors"" and that seems too demanding. It simply keeps the passion going for both of us, not just one.

I do not think I understand his comment wrong. He seems to think the app is strictly ""do this then sex,"" which is clearly not the case. Even looking at the screenshots I do not understand how he could see the manipulation in that. I will say this, being honest and working with relationship counselors, that if any type of manipulation is a concern with the app, the issue is not with the app itself. The manipulative relationship already exists, a smartphone application is not going to create that type of issue.";3;-5;True;True;False;web development

This is Levent from Needsflow marketing team.

Schop App. is a product of Needsflow brand which creates solutions to improve the shopping experience.

While we were searching for an image based shopping list maker, we failed to find an appropriate solution so, we decided to build one. 

What distinguishes Schop App. from others:

- It‚Äôs an image based shopping list. ( not icons etc. )
- You can add products by scanning their barcodes or simply speaking.
- Products you purchase and clear from your lists are stored in your purchase history so that you can have your own shopping history. 

If you want to add more than 30 items to your list, all you need to pay is 1$ to unlock the item limit.

It‚Äôs only available for iOS platform right now, and we are working for Android as well.

Could you expand on that a little more?

The idea I had was that it helps people calculate alarms (and sleep times) based upon their selected cycle, but maybe you would be interested in more information/the idea behind each sleep cycle?
@chrisgscott I completely get where you are coming from!!

IO am currently on a Bi-Phasic sleeping pattern. , it works nicely as I work remotely and my partner works a typical job (9-5). Meaning I go sleep with her, wake up mid way through her sleep, then nap somewhere in the day whilst she is at work. 

Allowing my free time/waking time to line up with hers nicely. I can only imagine adding more factors (like kids) into the mix makes it hard to try other, more extreme cycles.

But, my plan is to add more cycles that may be more usable, as well as improve the schedule (to actually book it into you calendar, maybe even hook it to google home (or alexa). So, hopefully I stumble upon an ideal
@chrisgscott Wow, thank you so much for so many awesome ideas!! 

The ""start sleep cycle"" always felt a bit weird to me too, so I have put that at the top of my list.

A ""how to"" is also a great idea, some may not know what to expect when swapping (instant results, for example).

Examples are a great idea too, I did do little clock-icons but I don't think those are clear enough, maybe an actual timeline is better, and be displayed on the individual cycle-pages themselves.

And yes, all cycles are not built equally. Someone I work with actually tried the Uberman Cycle as an experiment, and found that they were tired all the time, missing alarms, etc and just could not transition, even after an extended period. The issue is, these are very personal variables, so may have to do sweeping-pros/cons with great detail. (Maybe ""difficulty indicator""?

and, a quiz is also a good idea. taking ""find your perfect sleep cycle"" to the next level.

I will have to brainstorm on that and see what questions to ask.

thank you for your interest in this product. I hope, you'll find it useful.

You may ask, why there isn't a simple API, because that's what most of similar websites provide. The answer is: We had one. This project already exists for more than a year. There was the API, a website for the API and a huge API documentation. However, we believe, that the privacy of your users is extremely important and one should avoid sending personal informations over the internet whenever possible.

So we had to think about how we can provide a service, that is completely privacy aware.

Another thing is availability. Most developers are using this kind of APIs for registration processes, contact form validations and much more. A slow API will also slow down your own service, but you can't expect high availability of a completely free product.

So we had to think about how we can provide a service, that is highly available but affordable.

The solution: Throw everything away and provide the data that is needed to build your own service. That's the reason, why there's no API, but a Github repository, where you can get the data.

However, simply providing the data without any ""example"" is useless. A domain without a website is useless, too. So we've just built the introduced product. It can be useful for those, who quickly want to lookup a domain and/or an email address, but it can also be an inspiration for developers, which are looking for an affordable or even free solution against disposable email addresses. At least, building this website was useful for us, because we had the chance to try some things, that were completely new to us.

This project is absolutely privacy aware. We do not store or analyze anything, because we are not interested in how this ""example"" is used. But we are open for feedback to improve it.

@rrhoover Thanks again for all your support!  For me, I absolutely love this app. It does exactly what I need (scratching my own itch) and I stand by 100%.  With that, I definitely have no issue in refunding anyone who's dissatisfied (within a reasonable time of course). But I will tell you, I haven't had to refund a single person thus far so I think the app speaks for itself for many?
@shepovalovdenis Thank you good sir!
@rrhoover Great question! This is what I'm most proud of with the app is its security in mind.  Absolutely Zero data is shared anywhere. I literally don't even have a backend supporting the app except for the app itself.  It's fully contained and running solely on your machine.  All Google Analytics requests are securely transferred between the locally running app (for display only) and Google and that's it! Also, the app doesn't even store or cache any Google Analytics data whatsoever.  What you see is live stats always at every request.

TL;DR I have zero possible access and cannot see any metrics being reported through the app.
@rrhoover Hey thanks for purchasing? So that error indicates you might not have your service credential setup.  In the drop down on Edit Service do you have a key setup with an account id displayed?  If not, you'll have to set that up (following the link ""Click here to get setup with a key"") or you're setup already , restart the app and maybe a connection issue occurred. I've seen it occur also if your clock is off for some reason I think the sandboxing of the app prevents it from calling google's api if not in sync some kind of security precaution but this is rare.";4;-3;True;True;False;community

There are a bunch of solid integrations in today (Stripe, Google Analytics, Mailchimp, several others...) More integrations are certainly on the way.  

Google Sheets integration can be used to pipe in data from almost anywhere, as long as you can get it into a Google Sheet (Zapier!).

Oh, and the app is 100% mobile-friendly.  Install it onto your iPhone/Android home screen to get your metrics on your phone.

The automatic email reports are my favorite part (and the reason I built Sunrise in the first place!).  Choose between Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual reports.

We use the VPN API to act as middleman on your traffic, and then we make VPN tunnels on both your Wi-Fi and cell.  This lets us pick, packet by packet which connection to use for your traffic.  If Wi-Fi is good we use that, if the Wi-Fi is not good ( < 3 Mbps or so ) then we'll use both Wi-Fi and cellular to smooth over the problems.
@zelena Yes, what happen is that it will use little bits of cellular (sometimes just for a second or three) to fill in the gaps as your phone switches from one Wi-Fi to another.
@alon_keren The way it works, it's actually a bonding VPN.  It uses the VPN API to act as middle man for your traffic, and then it has connections on both the cellular and wifi, so it can pick whether to use wifi or cellular from moment to moment.
@alon_keren One of the engineers is a passionate bird watcher, and generally quiet guy.  When talking about mission and who we want to be, he launched into a passionate pitch for Project SNOWstorm, and the fate of the snowy owls. It was surprising and beautiful, and when he was done it was clear we'd found our cause. SNOWstorm is a great organization and we're happy to be donating to them to support their work.
@pregenun Yes, we were working on this when 1.1.1.1 came out... honestly, when we saw 1.1.1.1 was basically the exact same, except the location of the menu button, we started wondering if they had figured out something important about menu button placement.  So we moved our menu button to the centered bottom just like they had it, but it didn't seem right at all, and we put it back to the top where we had put it in the first place.

EdgeWise will come to Android... we have the whole core engine running on Android, it's missing the user interface.  But as we did keep the interface one button, that's not much of an excuse.
@jakemor @sam_ayres They had a ""Wi-Fi Assist"" feature.   But it didn't work: if it saw a wifi not working well, it would stop using it for a long time without telling you.  So if you took your trash out, while you were outside it would decide that your home wifi was terrible and stop using it.  then you'd go back in the house and you'd be stuck on cellular for hours.  We'll keep testing the non-working wifi so that we see the moment it starts working again to use.   And it didn't do anything to move your connections between wifi and cell without say hanging up on voice calls and interrupting downloads.
@the_minh Not available in France or China.  There's a big pile of import paperwork that France requires.  I have the forms, and will take this as a reminder to get them all filled in and submitted.
@usamaejaz My understanding is that the samsung solution is a hard cutover: breaking any downloads or video calls you're in the middle of when it give up on Wifi.  We're a lot smoother, with the ability to smoothly give just some traffic to cell, and then move all your connections from wifi to cell without interrupting any of them.
@pronouncedjerry I assume you tried tapping the giant switch in the middle of the screen, so I'm sorry to hear it's not working.

My name is Anatoli, I'm a software engineer from Berlin. 

‚è∞ One of my new year resolutions for 2019 is to be mindful about my time online. And so far Youtube has been the biggest rabbit hole. I often watch lectures and conference talks, but you know this moment when Youtube recommends you something interesting. You wake up after couple of hours watching about Wim Hof method, details of Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, ""exercises that will keep you fit only in 7 minutes a day"" etc etc.

‚òù IMO it's not bad at all, there's no need to be judgmental or even negative about it. I just believe that if I keep track of time it'll be much easier to avoid falling in the loop.

- who want to create their own product with a great starter project

Last week on cryptotwitters @btsfav was requesting a blockchain based product which I thought would be cool to make! A simple blockchain (proof of time) storage of file hashes to proof file integrity based on a trustless environment. 

And this is what I made - Proof.ink - a 24hr weekend endeavour using all tools out there: 
- Steem.io Developer SDK's
- Undraw.co - thank you @bramk for reminding me
- Bootstrap, Cryptojs and Filehashing, Filesaver.js
- Stackoverflow.com

I think proof.ink is a nice little web app focussing on 1 thing only, namely generating an offline file hash/fingerprint and optionally storing it on the Steem blockchain for proof of time.

You can use it for example in fav's usecase: ""So I got a signed PDF, and all parties need to be able to verify the hash on chain via a tool to check whether it's still the original file"". Thanks @fav for the inspiration!

Let me know what you think?
@bobinsonkb oh yes that shipping thing is interesting. And you have all the ""provenance"" initiatives. I like the Steem chain indeed for being available publicly and also the fast confirmation times and fee-less posting, which has low entry barriers for users to start using services like these ?

I launched PhonePrivacy a few months ago. I got a decent amount of feedback so I re-built, polished and added features (better SMS interface, native notifications, better pricing, support for numbers from any country, support for communication to any country... just tons). 

One solution that PhonePrivacy is a great fit for is reducing the amount of automated / telemarketing calls. Rather than giving away your single number to everyone, you can make a specific number for throwaway uses then block or even delete the numbers later. I think of it like having a single email vs having wildcard emails.

I'd love to hear your ideas and questions. :)

Up is a free and open-source tool for deploying and managing apps and APIs to your own AWS account in a single command, utilizing Lambda for near-infinite automatic scaling and extremely cost-effective on-demand pricing.

Up is focused on deploying ""vanilla"" HTTP applications, there's no need to learn a new framework or manage individual Lambda functions‚Äîyou can use Express.js, Koa, Golang, Django or whatever you prefer. You can think of it more like a serverless Heroku.

Up Pro adds additional functionality such as encrypted per-stage environment variables, instant rollbacks, alerting, and a deployment log, for $10/mo ‚Äî using the ""product-hunt"" coupon. There are no restrictions on many team members or the number of applications you can deploy.
@simon_mansfield thanks Simon!
@tanakasamuel thanks :D glad you're liking it!
@ninalimpi thank you ?
@engmsaleh good question! The primary difference is that Up is designed specifically for existing paradigms, you write your app/API as you always would locally with any HTTP framework you like, and then `up` to deploy it. You could think of it as a serverless Heroku, letting you test apps locally very easily and use existing knowledge. 

Serverless (and others) by contrast require specific knowledge of the serverless ecosystems, where you're managing individual Lambda functions per-route, and writing your application to fit that model. 

I don't have remote debugging functionality right now, I'd have to look into that.
@engmsaleh @o1lab yep that's correct. 

Technically what it actually does is run your application inside of Lambda, via `node server.js`, or `./main` for binaries etc, and Up has an internal proxy which takes the Lambda API Gateway event, and translates it back into HTTP, forwarding it to your server.

This is what lets Up provide middleware features such as CORS, logging, redirects, error pages and gzip compression as well. It sounds like it would introduce latency, but in practice it's very low, typically less than 1ms.
@vandanic yeah the logo part was unfortunate, mine is supposed to be an ""A"" but kind of looks like a triangle. As for the aesthetic in general, I've always had a minimalistic monochrome style, long before Zeit existed. Hell their v2 stuff looks a lot like Up, it's basically a router in front of Lambda.

Have you or your kids always been intimidated by sheet music or music theory?

We at Compoze believe that learning music shouldn't be hard, you just need the right tool for the job. 

For music students of all levels and ages, we are introducing ScoreSkills for iOS -  a fun and easy way to learn music theory and train your musical skills - that requires no previous knowledge in music or even owning an instrument.
Download the app, play bite size levels and before you know it you‚Äôll understand music like a pro.

What makes ScoreSkills special?

- this is not another ""Guitar Hero""- ScoreSkills treats music like a language and teaches it like one- reading, writing, listening, speaking (sight reading,
music transcription, ear training, humming exercises - coming soon)
- It takes a subject that‚Äôs traditionally hard to learn and makes it fun, engaging and easy.
- You can use it anywhere - no musical instrument needed.
- Turbo charges your music learning

We've just launched with over a thousand levels, covering well over what is taught in most first year music curriculums, and will launch thousands more so the app fits musicians of all levels. 

On a personal note, we've started Compoze five years ago with the goal of making life easier for musicians around the world and bringing music education to the masses. Launching ScoreSkills today is a big step towards this goal. I‚Äôm so proud of all of us at Compoze for this important achievement.  

There's nothing we'd like more right now than to hear your feedback after you've tried it.
Download the app, play with it, share it and let us know all about it.

I made Protect IID inspired by the recent Jeff Bezos National Enquirer scandal, ""Collection #1"" Data Breach and tweets by @levelsio (https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1085785937601212417).

The idea is to start treating email addresses that you use when signing up for a service similarly as passwords. They should be unique, generated and used only once. You store them with your password inside a password manager.

I've gathered all the information about single-use email addresses and published in on the Protect IID page. You'll learn how they work, how to set your own with a few clicks and you can download an official Protect IID Chrome extension that generates single-use email addresses for you. 

If there's something you think is missing or you know how to explain something more clearly, please, let me know! :)

Hello Product Hunt!

We are super-happy to launch Unreadit on Product Hunt today. Unreadit is a selection of weekly newsletters that delivers the best of Reddit in your inbox every week. 

There are newsletters for all tastes:

? Indie Makers: https://unread.it/n/indie-makers
‚òÄÔ∏è Self Improvement: https://unread.it/n/self-improvement
? Tech: https://unread.it/n/tech
? Entrepreneurship: https://unread.it/n/entrepreneur
? Design https://unread.it/n/design

These newsletters surface the best content even from smaller subredditts with a custom algorithm we developed. The other piece of the cake is a lot of manual curation that we use to remove irrelevant content and write intros for each newsletter.

This is the first project we develop since going full-time on our side-project and it took 2 weeks from start to finish. 

We are happy to answer any questions you may have about the technical side, design, monetization, whatever really.
@taylormajewski Thank you! The main inspiration for this project was the fact that we miss on great Reddit content if we don't go there every day. We are mostly Reddit casual users, so we built this for ourself, to not sink a ton of time in Reddit and still get to see the best of the best for our favorite topics.

We have a plan to target also Reddit power users (with custom newsletters), but we are still evaluating if this could make sense. Most Reddit power users just live in their Reddit clients and I don't think they would benefit from an email digest, at least not enough to pay for it!";3;-2;True;True;False;creativity

I just built this open source npm library to easily invite your users to support you on Product Hunt.
I actually did it in order to learn how to build an open source npm library that I could use for my own products (I was always wondering how to make one ?).
You just need to copy paste some code to your website to run it. It takes no more than 1 minute ?.

You can also customize the widget passing some parameters: colors, text, url, size and use it for non Product Hunt related promotion!
Also it will appear only once per user by default (except if you decide the opposite).

Feel free to fork it, improve it and change it as you want! I hope you like it ‚ô•Ô∏è

Craig Barber here, London-based Product Designer and creator of LandingStock.

I spend a lot of time creating landing pages for new projects and business ideas.

Finding a quality, free image for your landing page can be tough. You can pay for a subscription on Shutterstock. But it‚Äôs expensive. Especially if you‚Äôre just testing a new idea.

To solve this problem I‚Äôve launched https://LandingStock.com

LandingStock is the result of hours spent browsing free image sites like Freepik, Moose and Unsplash in search of the best, free landing page images.

What makes a perfect landing page image?

Being a designer, I‚Äôm really picky when it comes to landing page images. Images featured on https://LandingStock.com must meet a certain criteria:

‚úÖ Must be a high quality photo
‚úÖ Can‚Äôt be cheesy
‚úÖ Must be clean and minimalistic
‚úÖ Must have some space for copy
‚úÖ Must crop well
‚úÖ Must be useful and practical


I‚Äôm starting the collection with 35 images in two categories. People and technology. If people find the site useful, I‚Äôll keep searching and adding more images to the collection as and when I find them.

Questions, comments and all feedback welcome!

Craig
@rhysbeingsocial Thanks Rhys! I appreciate the kind words. It does take time to find suitable images. Will add more when I find them : )
@leowood69869720 Hey Leo, thanks for the kind words. Yes, at the very least it saves people time trawling through huge free stock sites for that perfect image for your landing page. It seems people like it, so yes I'll keep adding more images when I find them : )";3;-2;True;True;False;community

Thank you for your comment.

Actually it is a great question, that many of our users ask us.

We built a smart matching algorithm.
Usually it is very simple, we have the name and the artist of the song and we search it with the api of the target platform.

The hard part is when the name of the songs are saved in a different way in different music services. For example in YouTube you need to find the exact version of the song etc. 

Another problem we encountered - When we check that the result we got from the different music services we have to detect irrelevant part and ignore them (For example - ""Live show Amsterdam 2017"").

Of course - This is just the tip of the iceberg :)
Hi @meshoo12  
Thank you for your kind comment :)

Regarding your 2 questions
1) You are absolutely right. Right now there is a workaround, You can convert to CSV file and then convert again from CSV. We are planning to add it as a built in feature very soon.
2) We are working on it :)

1. While ProductHunt's Ship does accomplish this somewhat, it's less of a leaderboard. Also, I've tried Ship and the features are somewhat limited with the paid membership starting at $80/mo. ?

2. Great suggestion. Will implement!

3. Definitely like the idea to share your post on social. Helps get a broader audience and more perspectives. Facebook comments is a maybe‚ÄìI feel like Facebook is ""uncool"", and people generally feel less easy with direct integration like that, but I'll think about it!

@jimmy1 Thank for feedback.

At the first attempt, I tried to write Electron-based app, but eventually it consumes too much memory and CPU during debugging. There are many friends complain about it. Thus, it's really bad for experiences.

The selling point of Proxyman is that it's exclusive built on native macOS with an intuitive UI. I strictly follow the macOS Human Interface Guidelines from Apple. Performance and easy to use are the key.
@agweber @williamukoh Yes it's free for all essential features. Such as, HTTPS debug on macOS, iOS simulator and iOS device and handy debugger tools to increase your productivity.

Every two weeks, I will push new version. If you have any request, please let me know via my Repo: https://github.com/ProxymanApp/Proxyman/issues.

Thank you in advance ?
@chadwhitaker Although Proxyman is primarily focus on debugging for iOS dev and QA.
It also capable of detecting suspicious data from new mac apps.

@rawoyemi Hi Richard! Thanks for the feedback! 

I do think it will remain free to an extent. I will probably need to tweak the free word limit, number of allowed submissions per day and/or turnaround time as I get more submissions and assess workload. But, my intention is to have an ""always free"" version funded by these many potential revenue streams.
@niklaspivic666 Hi Niklas! Great questions. 

Right now I'm accepting all kinds of texts. I'm a professional editor, so I can handle most of it. However, I will outsource some texts that I feel less comfortable with. For example, I just received a fiction submission and I feel more comfortable having a fiction editor take that one. 

As of right now, this product is very basic. The text is saved to a database and sent directly to my email. I wouldn't recommend sending over very sensitive material just yet. 

The only thing I will do to the texts submitted is edit and provide feedback. I'll never use the texts in any other way or share with anyone else. 

To be honest, I had no idea this would get so much interest. Over the next week, I'll be working hard to make Proofree much more secure and robust. I'll start by making a FAQ page where questions like yours are answered, as well as drafting a Terms of Use and Privacy Policy so people can feel more confident submitting their material.
@justinfinkel Thanks, Justin! I'll have to check out what's going on on mobile. I've only done quick tests which worked fine. Good luck with your book! :)

The contacts wouldn't be found because I only save contact ID from apple that doesn't contain identifying information.
@istereotype it would certainly be possible. I could label contacts with SMS or iMessage. Can I ask why exactly? Or do you hate the green bubbles that much ?
@rrhoover I'm happy you like it! That's for the support!
@resh I agree, it is difficult to clear. I'm hoping to make the project open source in the not too distant future. My goal in that screen was to just be as transparent as possible. It is a lot of access to allow, perhaps in the future I could have an iMessage only option. One of the requirements for Full Disk Access (if you have Mojave) is to determine if the person you are messaging uses iMessage or SMS. It isn't possible, to my knowledge, to determine in any other way. 

I don't know if they'd green light the app, its why I haven't attempted to put it on the App Store yet. But they allow you to grant Full Disk Access to apps you trust so I can't imagine it would be an automatic no.";3;-4;True;True;False;community

many thanks for letting me post my first product here after being a member for 3 years. I'm really happy and proud to announce the CoinBlick iOS version to the community today. It was 9 hard months being fully employed and working on this great side project. ???

CoinBlick is an aggregator for Crypto News. I implemented an AI that looks for the most important articles on Crypto and analyses their sentiment, to provide an indicator of how important, positive or negative an article is. That basically came from my own pain of being a cryptocurrency investor myself and not being able to parse all the news coming in daily. Besides that, there was no app providing a beautiful, native, and nice user experience for reading crypto news. That's why I decided to build CoinBlick and help also others to digest the huge amount of news daily.

To summarize the features quickly:
- Automated Sentiment Analysis
- News from all your favorite Websites
- Most important tweets and Reddit submissions
- Reactions and Bookmarks on articles
- Comprehensive Chart Analysis
- Notifications about most trending articles

The backlog of features is growing from day to day and CoinBlick is not final yet. It's just the first iteration and I would like to hear your opinion if you like it and what should I work on next. Please comment below: ???
@raphs_rocha Thanks Rafael, Hope that CoinBlick helps you as it is helping me!

Hello PH! I'm Dave, the solo maker of ToDesktop.

? Today, after months of beta and refinement, I'm really excited to launch ToDesktop!

With ToDesktop your users can install your web app to their computer and launch it from the same place as other desktop apps on Windows, Mac and Linux.

‚ùìWhy does this make sense?

* Dropping the URL bar and tab bar makes your app's UI look much cleaner and less cluttered
* One-click launch from the start menu, desktop or dock
* Having a native feel is important to users. It gives them confidence that your app is solid

? I'd like to think that it's a super friendly and easy-to-use product, but it packs some punch too with advanced features like code signing and auto-update.
@joelennon Wow, thanks Joe ?

Auto-updates happen automatically, our last update was 18 days ago and I'd expect updates will happen monthly-ish going forward but it depends a bit on the Electron release schedule. Security updates are prioritised so if there's a security fix released to Chrome or Electron then you can expect to see an auto-update release in less than 24 hours. We will offer more control over auto-updates in the future so you can scale back the regularity of auto-updates if desired.

One addition to this. If you change any of your app settings (for example, if you change your app's icon) and do a re-build then that will automatically release a new build to auto-update.

The final thing to say about updates is version numbers. At the moment, every new update increments the minor version number. So your initial build will be `1.0.0`, if you do a re-build or we do an automated platform update then the updated version will be `1.1.0`.
@rrhoover Wow, you read my mind. That's literally the product I'm working on right now. Should be ready by early May but please shush! ?

My last startup (which failed because I couldn't find enough paying customers) was a menubar app built with Electron too (so I have a bit of experience): https://pin.gy/
@owenfar1 You need to meet a few requirements (both technical and engagement) to get DPWAs working on Chrome. You're also left in the lurch if your users are using Firefox for example. With ToDesktop you can just have a download button. DPWAs are awesome though! :)
@kelvinangstrom Yes, we have a customer that uses Firebase and Firebase Auth. The only thing to be aware of is: when you're building the app you'll need to configure the option for ""Internal URLs"" and enter a regex for any third-party OAuth windows that you wish to support.
@ayush_chandra Yes, you don't need to be a developer to use ToDesktop. I'm a big fan of the NoCode movement personally! No technical knowledge is required :-).
@sungho 

1) You can't customize the installer at the moment but it will have you icon and app name. Check the screenshots at the top of this product hunt page for a preview of what the installer will look like.

We are about to start development of ""nested collections"". With that you then can also import all your subfolders you have on those services. 

Just keep the files and reimport them once it goes live and then it will copy your structure there too!

And yes, agreed. Browsers should be much smarter. The aim/hope/goal we have is that Memex adapts itself into the browser at some point. We laid out important pieces to achieve that: 
1) Open source software so Memex can adapt itself for different environments/use cases
2) Data interoperability & ownership (so users can easily move between different variants of Memex) 
3) An economic model called Steward Ownership that does not require us to grow infinitely and dominate the market in order to provide returns for people contributing time and money.

The main use cases for MoviePrint currently are
‚Ä¢¬†Archiving, to keep track of your movies and speed up browsing
‚Ä¢¬†Creation of a visually appealing summary of a movie in a single image
‚Ä¢¬†Analysis, to easily browse through a movie, jump into scenes, scrub through shots, analyse motion or do quantitative analysis (work in progress)
@goldy_arora 
This use case is possible, but not out of the box. Depending on the length of the movie, you can crank up the grid size to get a thumb for every frame. When you then save the MoviePrint you have the option to also save all frames in addition.
@nick_savarese `
This is definitely a use case MoviePrint could be used in. 
‚Ä¢ drag in a movie
‚Ä¢ add a MoviePrint (shot detection based) -> analysis the movie and creates a MoviePrint based on shots
‚Ä¢ expand specific scenes -> creates MoviePrints for every shot you expand
‚Ä¢ save all MoviePrints -> batch creates image files from all MoviePrints you have in your list
In case you try it out, I would be curious to learn more about how it worked out for you :-)
Thanks for all the comments!

Just thought that I also write the ""long"" story about how it came to be:

My journey with MoviePrint started out 15 years ago when I wrote my master thesis in architectural theory. It was called ""Film space, architecture of the mind"". For this I was doing an analysis of a movie for which I had taken over 1200 screenshots and arranged them in a grid. This should help me get a feel for the different scenes, their locations and style. I was fascinated by the outcome and the idea of creating the perfect representation of a movie in a single image. 
A couple of years later I worked as a motion graphics artist. Part of the job was to create mood boards for clients. These are essentially collages of videos, images or other elements to inspire or visualise your design ideas. But finding specific videos one had archived proofed to be quite time consuming. I figured that browsing a catalog of images is a lot faster than browsing a folder with videos. So I created the first version of my tool allowing you to batch process videos to create contact sheets | index prints | thumbnail views. And as if there weren't already enough names for it I started to call them MoviePrints :-)
When I started updating my app last year I based it on the open source computer vision library openCV. Currently it is only used for doing simple shot segmentation and dominant colour extraction, but the possibilities are endless. Goal is to use more computer vision algorithms to create better representations of movies and visually more interesting ways to visualise and navigate time.";3;-2;True;True;False;community

@trovo good point. The thing is the form should be 100% customized by the designer using the product, so there's no point in showing the components. I did show a few examples of how this can be used in other presentation, but including that in the landing would be smart move. Thanks for the comment, Moises!

So I was in a situation a while ago when I wanted to post a clip I had uploaded to YouTube in the past to my Instagram account. To my surprise, this was quite a laborious task. The only way I could do this is to use a tool to download the video clip in a format that works for Instagram, manually send it to my phone and then post it.

I thought surely there must be a better way of doing this. To be honest, I sort of assumed there would already be tools doing this, as there are a plethora of ""convert to"" sites.

Anyway, if this is something I would find useful, maybe a few others would as well. So here it is!

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

@androidlove Hey Carlos. Thanks for checking out the tool :) Yes the Pro version of the product is $12 a month. Although you can go ahead and post videos for free if you don't require the Pro features :)
@pauljohncleary Doh! Thanks so much for pointing that out, I've turned off the error report in production.

From time to time I get clients sending me images with black borders (mostly only on 2 sides of the image) so I need to crop each of them to get the image for the website.  Has anyone else come across this?  It is pretty annoying.

I thought those with no coding knowledge, no special programs, apps or scripts might benefit from a quick way to do this, so I built Trimmy!

I can introduce new features if people need them:

**Choose colour to remove**
You can pick the colour to trim off the image(s)

**Resize**
Set pixel width or height and resize image(s) keeping the ratio

**Optimise**
Set quality percentage

...plus more!

It is in beta but check it out and let me know what you guys and gals think.

I hope it is of use to others.
@gregw Sorry it didn't work for you. I think I need to try and explain it better!  It will trim down until it hits something that isn't white/black/transparent but with straight edges only, it won't remove the entire background (for the moment at least).

Check out the 2nd and last screenshots above.

2nd screenshot - Timmy has a load of white space to the right
Last screenshot - Timmy is trimmed tight, the white space is removed

Clients were sending me images with white/black space to the bottom/top/right of the image.  I am pretty sure they were just taking a screenshot of their phone ? I just wanted to get the image with no borders, so I made this.
To show exactly what Trimmy does I've added some quick examples into the gallery above.

We started Replika as a more general purpose AI friend, that‚Äôs there to support you and learn more about yourself. As we saw over 4 million people try Replika we also started getting thousands of reviews and emails from people telling us that talking to Replika helped them deal with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and other mental health challenges. So we teamed up with clinical psychologists and game designers and came up with this new update that allows you to chat with your AI buddy at any time but at the same time offers you your own mental wellness journey of conversations based on evidence-based psychosocial interventions. Basically, having someone in your life and feeling heard + the best practices from CBT that you can learn with your companion are what make Replika helpful!
We believe in conversations that can make people feel better - and that AI can help us not only deliver them at scale, but also will learn over time make them more helpful. We‚Äôre rolling out the new update this week for both iOS and Android!

I really appreciate the Product Hunt community sharing this as my goal is to help all startups with their SEO and I believe they shouldn't have to pay money to generate more traffic.

If you are wondering what Backlinks does:

1. You can easily see who links to you or your competitors. This helps you figure what links you need to build to rank higher on Google.

2. Now link reports are integrated into Ubersuggest. You can see who links to a site's most popular pages.

3. You can see a site's domain score. Typically the higher the number the higher a site will rank.

4. You can filter links by almost anything you want. From anchor text to zones... you can drill down to the type of links you are interested in. This way you aren't spending hours trying to find new opportunities.

Oh and if you use Ubersuggest on a regular basis, you may have to hard refresh or clear your cache to see the new Backlinks feature/report.

I'm finally launching my second product!


Backstory - I need to fix this ?Ô∏è

Regularly when I'm coming back to sites I'm signed out again. So far pretty normal. When I want to sign in again I often struggle to remember how I signed in last time. Was it Google? Facebook? Or Twitter? ?Ô∏è I vaguely remember that I used one of these - but I'm not sure which one. I click on my best guess and it doesn't take long to realize: Nope, that wasn't it. I've just created a new account ?Ô∏è

Whenever this happened I solve the problem and went back to what I actually wanted to do. I usually put it off as ""I'm the only one being to unable to remember."" Until the day I spotted a tweet and realized: I'm not the only one ?Ô∏è

Should I solve this? ?Ô∏è Yea, let's give it a try.


The solution ?Ô∏è

I've decided to build a solution for it and learn how to build a browser extension along the way. The same night I started by adopting examples Mozilla provided. After a number of rewrites, it's stable and working as I hope ?Ô∏è

It's now checking the last pages accessed while you surf. If a sign-in is recognized, it adds the name of the network (Twitter, Facebook, Google or GitHub) to the page. No data is sent to my server, ever. Everything stays in the local storage ?Ô∏è


Keen to get it? ?Ô∏è

Head over to WhichLogin.com or the Chrome Store link on the top right. I highly appreciate if you would check it out and give me feedback ?Ô∏è 

Peter ?Ô∏è

Thanks @mubaris ?Ô∏è

Thanks @edisonjoao6871 ?Ô∏è
Hello @vicky_buddie 

that's actually a pretty good question. The extension can only detect which network you used at the moment. But adding an option to add a note should be feasible. This way you could manually add ""1"" or ""2"" for example. Do you think this would solve your problem?

Peter
Yeah, I see. I'd have to see how this could be implemented with the different platforms (Firefox/Chrome). Thanks @android_bull @sukhpal_saini1!

Thank you so much for the positive vibes, Danielle! Yourself and @jamesivings have been so amazing, kind & supportive. I really appreciate it ‚ù§Ô∏è
@gmaxi_ Hey Maxi ? Thank you so much!

The primary focus of Darwin Mail is to help you be your most productive. I'm sure the tool will evolve over time as users suggest new features & updates!

I can't wait to see how it evolves over time! ?
@mubaris Thank you so much, Mubaris ? 

Ever since I heart Inbox was shutting down I knew that there would be so many unhappy people, including me.

For that reason I decided to create DarwinMail ?

I really appreciate your support man ?
@anthilemoon Thank you, Anne ?

I really wanted to release sooner however I wanted to build more features to make sure DarwinMail was a product worth trying out ?‚Äç?

So now we have features like dark mode, undo send and custom backgrounds that you can try out ?

@gusraggio Yes, absolutely! Thank you for asking.

I'm currently working on the web app. With our Product Hunt release, our being on the front page of Hacker News, and all the suggestions and feedback coming in, I should have enough information to make DarwinMail extremely stable.

After it has achieved this stability, I will add support for more email clients!

As a foreign language speaker myself, I started developing this app years ago and released it recently. I focused on two problems I personally experienced, the first one is the ability to find out what I need to learn.  And the second one was how to do it efficiently.  

I began thinking about how we enlarge our vocabulary naturally. It is a common knowledge that people with huge vocabularies read a lot, loves dictionaries of all kind, takes notes and takes their time for their passion for learning.  It gave me the concept. 

I designed my app to list all the words in any content you loaded and let you hide the words you know. By doing that, after a while, It starts listing the new words specific to you in seconds. And you can see all the usages of words in sentences in the context you chose by your interests. This way you make connections, grasp the meaning and remember.

The second part was customizing the browsing experience for this purpose. I added an in-App browser where you can simply drag the words from your word list and also switch your favourite search pages from the menu, your own toolset including images, dictionaries, thesaurus, corpora, virtual search etc.

I know it is not perfect but I hope it would be useful for people like me.
@lucien_luijkx1 Thank you for your interest. I released a lite version with minor limitations, multi-selection with gestures and search page customisation are not included in that but you can test almost everything else.

@ben_roe Unfortunately that's beyond the scope of MailtoUI at the moment. But alternatively, you could use a service like CloudFlare, which provides free automatic email obfuscation for your mailto links, among lots of other features. MailtoUI plays well with CloudFlare's email obfuscation. Hope this helps!
@sravang Thank you, Sravan! Yes, that's something I'd like to look into. Now that MailtoUI is pretty stable, I can look into creating a Chrome extension.
@devinrajaram Thanks so much, Devin!
@parterburn Thanks so much, Paul! That's not an option at the moment, but I can see how that could be useful. I'll definitely look into it. However, keep in mind that for better or worse, Yahoo is still a widely used email client, so your users may benefit from having that option. Thanks for the suggestion!
@ricalamino Thank you for your feedback! That's an interesting idea I honestly hadn't thought about. I'll look into it. Alternatively, at the moment you can customize all text in MailtoUI using the Options feature, if you need to use a different language.
@williamhutech Hi William, that's something to look into. As a js library, the advantage is that  MailtoUI can be added to a website by the developer and it will work everywhere, across all browsers. A Chrome extension would be nice though, to put that control on the user's end. Thanks for the feedback!

Hi everyone!

Hiring is broken, have you noticed? If you're an employer who has searched for candidates, or you've been a job seeker, you've probably experienced challenges or obstacles in the search. 

The state of hiring today: Employers are increasingly opting for impersonal, automated hiring tools like job boards, chatbots, recorded video interviews, which eliminate personal connection. As a result, candidates have a subpar hiring experience, which is ultimately is affecting companies' bottom lines. 

Janeous' mission is to fix this problem by ""humanizing digital hiring."" With our recruiting ecosystem, we blend HR tech with a human connection from the first moment you begin your job search. The application process is seamless; interviews are ""live"" via video, you apply to active jobs - no waiting weeks or months to find out if you get a call back. Our dual-sided feedback system means your input matters. 

Happy candidates mean happy hiring professionals.

For employers, our eco-system will reduce hiring timelines, increase productivity, improve time-to-hire, boost your bottom line, and bring you an overall more streamlined and satisfying recruiting process. 

For complete product details, please visit our website: https://www.janeous.com Please reach out to us with any questions!";3;-2;True;True;False;web development

They post pictures of their plants, in all states of growth. Growing a plant is a project (and also a labor of love for many!) and it's a project that can be min/maxed just like any other hobby, so many people talk about the equipment uses, techniques used, etc.

For example, a woman who is a farmer in Humboldt just posted a photo of her and her crew tilling their raised beds that they built in a greenhouse. Or another example, a Colorado cannabis breeder posted a picture of one of his own cannabis strains he created.

I'm excited to share Paste.Work with you all. So what is it, you might ask? Paste.Work is a web app that allows you to easily copy and paste any text between devices.

We've all done it at some point. While in a seminar or working on a public computer where you don‚Äôt want to login into your mail or something but want some text/URL from that computer to be copied to your device or sometimes you want to share a link with everyone in a seminar.‚Ä®

I created Paste.Work with the goal of making these Inter-Device Copy Pasting tasks easy where all you have to do is write your text in one device and click Copy and you will get a small easy to remember the code. Now move onto the next device and click on Paste and then enter your code or if in a seminar share that code with everyone and boom you have that text in your other device/devices.

The recent soft launch between my friends generated lots of positive feedback, so it gave me the confidence to launch it here.‚Ä®

Thank you in advance PH Community, for taking the time to read and checking it out. I hope Paste.Work is useful to you all. And as always, any feedback is much appreciated.‚Ä®

This is an AI Art Project I have been working on. 

The idea was to create a dynamic Art Gallery that constantly re-generates new art while at the same time giving the images created a short exclusive life time (of 1 hour in this case) before the art is destroyed forever.

The gallery has 9 images that are re-created every hour using a class of Neural Networks called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS). Hence the name.

Let me know your thoughts :)

Hi! This is Sid

I recently become an independent developer (quit my job!) and started making courses and conducting workshops.

I get most of my audience from my twitter and youtube channel, so I've become more intentional about <i>building an audience.</i>

<i>""If you can't measure it, you can't improve it ‚Äî Peter Drucker""</i>

Started tracking them with pen and paper along with my morning coffee but I would forget doing this all the time! ? Realised I need it to be a <b>push not pull</b>.

And that's why I built this product! It keeps a track of my social accounts and sends me <b>an email every Monday.</b> (including my tiny newsletter)

https://sid.studio/metrics-coffee-screenshot.png

If you are trying to build an audience for yourself or your company, you might find this useful as well :)

<b> What's next? </b>

- Moar integrations: I only use a few social media platforms (screw facebook) and a handful of tools, I'd be happy to add your favorite tool

- Richer data: Followers is just scratching the surface, Engagement is where the fun is. I'd love to track how replies on twitter, open rate on newsletter, you get the picture

P.S. I made this product in 7 days and recorded <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZVuD5_lqlbNDtuUp-RHM_oGTHWyVqOG3"">a video every day </a>while building it.

WhenToLaunch helps you determine the optimum date to launch your product on Product Hunt.

This app is the outcome of a simple script that I built to analyze the trend of products and upvotes on Product Hunt using the ProductHunt API. I also wanted to track when users are most active on upvoting so that I could schedule the launch better. This will also help you track the trending topics on product hunt and collections and do a competitor analysis based on the reach of each product.

After building and using the script for a few days, I noticed that there are optimal times when a product should be launched to maximize views/upvotes. My gut told me that the best way to figure out when to launch my product was based on analyzing data, and I was proven right.

I shared my findings with a few of my fellow makers and asked if they also struggled to figure out when to launch their products. And guess what, they did. So I decided to publish this as an app, to make it easy for anyone to use this tool. 

This is a very modest start that could turn into a bigger analytics platform, but initially, does this solve anyone else's problem here? 

More analytics based on category and upvotes for products will be added to make the app better. Please let me know if you want something more to be added into this or any feedback here.
@beesum Hey Thanks Ben, Please let me know if you have any feedback or changes. Would help me shape up the app.

Since you asked, I am planning to have this as a one stop platform for analyzing the product information on Product Hunt. 
-> I am planning to add extra drill down features for Topics and Collections.

-> Reach out to people who are following similar posts/ topics so you get the right people you can target it to.
These are however in the roadmap and will soon update on the launches. ?

I am back on Product Hunt with a new direction for Courseroot. After grinding away at the product over the last year since the amazing successful PH launch of last year (#1), I wanted to take it into a new direction and make it more meaningful.

Not only is the platform much smoother and improved, we now take 50% of the profits we make and donate them to an amazing charity that you can choose ‚ù§Ô∏è

The idea for Courseroot 1.0 was very simple: make an amazing platform that helps you find the best courses and tutorials on the web. ‚úîÔ∏è

The idea for Courseroot 2.0 is better: take some of the opportunity that we have in terms of access to education and share it with those that have been less fortunate. ?

As an avid online learner, I have always felt so incredibly privileged with the access to high-quality educational resources. There are so many people, and especially kids, that do not have that same access. Even more so, they might not even be able to think about education because they are simply surviving. The goal is to distribute some of our opportunity to them ?

Each month I'll pick three amazing causes. This month it is water.org, Save the Children, and Blind Children's Learning Center. All in their own way they give children a better opportunity to grow and develop. 

If you want to donate directly to one of these amazing causes you can do so here: 
Water.org - https://water.org/
Save the Children - https://www.savethechildren.org/
Blind Children's Learning Center - https://www.blindkids.org/

Let me know what you think about the platform and the new direction. I'd love to hear your feedback, and I can use all the support to get it out there. ?

All the best,

Valentijn

Yes, you are absolutely right. Sometimes, luckily not too often, the search shows some partially related courses that might not be relevant. It's is really hard to get the accuracy to 100% but I will be looking at some ways of improving this.

Thank you very much for sharing that ? and I hope it can still be helpful to you.

All the best,

Valentijn
@christopher_lee4 Thanks Christopher! ? 

Yeah, for some reason ""instant search"" sounds neat though. But you are probably right haha. I am not a native English speaker so I might change that actually. 

Great that you like the UI and concept. Is it something that you yourself will be using? Are there things you'd like to see that are missing? Just to extract even more feedback from you ?";4;-2;True;True;False;creativity

@jaslintonton Hey Jaslin, I did quite a bit of research around pricing - especially as the market for influencer platforms is predominantly monthly based and the cheapest around is ~$75+pm (with restrictions). We think ¬£50 is quite fair for a brand, there's quite a bit going on behind the scenes in terms of scoring as well as aftercare.

@ayush_chandra Hi Ayush. Sendsecure.io does not require you to upload your files to any server or cloud, but executes the transfer directly to your recipient in real-time, by allowing to  arrange a direct browser-to-browser connection between you and your recipient.

Also, we are focused on security and comply to strict German and EU data privacy laws. We do not have access to the files that you transfer with us, as well as we do not use any third party analytics or advertisement tools. We are 100% GDPR compliant and gather only the minimum information that is required only for the service to function properly.

There is also a possibility to secure each transfer link with a password, so that the transfer would start only when your recipient enters the same password as you set. This ensures that even if someone intercepts your transfer link, he would not be able to start the transfer without knowing your password.

? The story
About two years ago, I started using Quora for marketing purposes. After reading a lot of material on the subject, I soon found out that you can get a lot more out of the platform if you analyze many questions and answer the ones with most potential. 
Since that‚Äôs a lot of work I soon found myself automating a lot of it ‚Ä¶ one month later, the first MVP of Find Better Questions was live. I‚Äôm super proud that today, it is at a stage where it‚Äôs ready for Product Hunt.

? How it works
Find Better Questions is actually a super simple tool. You just insert a Quora url, like ‚Äúhttps://www.quora.com/topic/Product-Hunt‚Äù and the tool gets you a list of matching questions along with their stats like views, followers and weekly views.

If you want to learn more about Quora marketing in general, I suggest you check out my guide to Quora marketing, which was hunted last month. ?https://www.producthunt.com/posts/the-ultimate-guide-to-quora-marketing

?Our best deal yet
Since being on Product Hunt has to be celebrated, you can get 50% off for life with ‚Äúproduct-hunt‚Äù this week. ?


I‚Äôd love to hear what you think about Find Better Questions (there‚Äôs a free trial ?) . Also leave a comment if you have any questions. I'm here all day (that is a European day) to answer them ?
@alexeyivanenko4 Not sure I understand your question. Quora is definitely a platform startups as well as most other businesses can use for their marketing. Just googling ‚Äúquora marketing‚Äù will present you with quite a couple of examples on how to do it. 
You can also check out my guide on Quora marketing ;)

Hello Product Hunters! :)

? I started CSS Scan 10 months ago with the vision of creating the fastest and easiest way to inspect and copy styles of any element across the web.

? Since then, it has grown to 3,800+ professional web developers users worldwide and received lots of improvements and new features - while still being easy and fun to use :)

‚ú® CSS Scan is especially useful for:
 - Discovering how your favorite websites are styled;
 - Debugging your own code;
 - Moving your codebase;
 - Copying specific elements from frameworks/themes/templates to use them without importing huge CSS files.

? CSS Scan is a paid extension that started as a side project and right now happily is my full-time work, so you'll always receive updates! ?

? To celebrate Mom's day is happening a limited 40% offer on the website!

? Try yourself a free demo here: https://getcssscan.com

? This is a work that has taken me almost 1 year so far, so I‚Äôm excited to share with you and genuinely interested in hearing what you think about it.

? Thanks to everyone that already bought it and supported my work!
If you have any ideas or suggestions, I'm all ears.
@aaronoleary Hey Aaron! Thanks for asking it :)

Since the first launch, I've added:
  + Code syntax highlighting
  + Show rendered font
  + Show element dimensions
  + Option to pin the box
  + Shortcuts (Lots of people asked)
  + Option to move the UI buttons to the bottom
  + Option to pause the scanner
  + Option to truncate classes names
  + Show :hover styles separated
  + Copy :hover styles merged or separated
  + Traverse the element and scan the parent
  + Identifies when elements are being overlapped
  + Now it works on iframes!
  + More shorthand rules support
  + i18n: Chinese (simplified and traditional) and Portuguese
  + Redesign UI and landing page

From a practical perspective, we can either have the product be self-service with a credit card, or sales-driven without one.  

I really *want* to make Nacho work at a self-service price point.  I didn't start SpyFu / Nacho to make billion dollar companies richer; I'm not here for the establishment. We're here to empower the little guy the wreak HAVOC on the establishment.

We‚Äôre here for the bootstrappers, the makers, and the game changers - the pitchers the grinders and the midnight coffee drinkers.  You guys.  The Product Hunting, entrepreneurs.

I don't want to have an enterprise sales-driven company, because I can't empower the people I want to empower with enterprise pricing.  

I intentionally set Nacho's pricing aggressively low not because it's necessary, but because it's possible.  Our competitors are priced 100x higher.  But, f them. 

Products have trade offs.  And pricing models have trade offs.  And in order to to have a low price, we have to get a credit card up front.  Otherwise, we get a *huge* amount of unqualified signups.

The solution is automation, but we knew that people still want to control what should be tracked. Enter ‚Äî rule-based automatic time-tracking.;1;-3;False;True;False;Long;Short;No;No;Rule-based automatic time-tracking;Medium;No;No;No;No;0;Yes;No;No;660148;Stas Moor;No;Yes;Low;Few;Yes;660148;Stas Moor;No;Yes;Low;Yes;"Hello everyone! I'm Stas the Founder and Designer at Klokki.
I am very excited to launch today and present to you Klokki the rule-based time-tracking for freelancers and makers. Our goal was to make time-tracking convenient and finally remove the need to start or pause a timer.

Being a freelancer myself, time-tracking was always something that's in the way because you constantly need to think about it. And yet, it is still very important to have. To put it simply ‚Äî time = money. So we thought, how can we solve that?

Automation is, of course, the first thing that comes to mind. But all the tools that provide automatic time-tracking also take away the control over what I actually want to track and make the whole process of linking time to a project cumbersome.

Therefore we've created ""Auto-Tracking"" which gives you the possibility to configure specific rules for your tasks. With this, you are able to tell Klokki that it should start tracking, as soon as you start working on file-x, or open site-y, or the combination of those two. We've included a variety of options that will give you endless configuration possibilities.

But besides the Auto-Tracking capabilities, we also wanted to retain the advantages of manual time-tracking. Hence you still will able to use the traditional start/pause controls. This way you have the perfect balance of automation and full control over your timekeeping.

And here are also some of the other features that Klokki has:
* Reports that help you visualize and review your data
* Flexible folders and tasks structure, which makes it super easy to manage your projects
* Klokki lives in your Menu Bar with a convenient mini-tracker
* Works offline
* Beautiful design, that is natively built for the Mac
* Billable hours are also coming very soon
* ‚Ä¶and much more

I am looking forward to reading your feedback and questions, and hope that you'll give Klokki a try by downloading the free 30-day trial at klokki.com. We really put a lot of time, effort and love into developing the app, and hope that you have a great time with it!

And to celebrate the launch ‚Äî Here is a promo code that will get you Klokki 50% off. Use it in the checkout process on the pricing page: FE29B073

Thank you all in advance!

P.S. For the purpose to clear things up in advance ‚Äî Klokki is a relaunch of the Timepal project, which ended because of a split between co-founders. Therefore I apologize for any confusion this might cause you. And if you are a previous Timepal Pro user, you can switch to Klokki for free. Just write to me at contact@klokki.com to receive the license. I am happy to answer any questions you might have.

Some time ago, I decided to delete my Facebook account. I exported my data, wrote a farewell post, and started thinking of what else I need to carry with me. Then I immediately realized that there's one feature that I'll be missing the most ‚Äî birthdays reminders.

So I decided to make a free app that will remind you about your friends' birthdays. I got inspired by my previous project ‚Äî <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/diary-email"">Diary Email</a>, private journal app that you write to using email, so I decided to explore the further the email topic.

Please welcome, Birthdays Reminder! It's a simple web app that reminds you of your friends' birthdays via email. After sign up you set up the reminder time and your timezone and at the day when a friend has a birthday, we'll send you an email at the specified time.

You can add birthdays manually or import data from Facebook.

The project maintenance costs me literally pennies, so I set to keep it alive forever.

If you like the product and want to support me, you can <a href=""https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kossnocorp"">buy me a coffee</a>
Fun fact! It took me 5 days from idea to implementation. You can see my journey here: https://twitter.com/kossnocorp/status/1130362458005229568
@parag_r yup, exporting to a calendar is another option. However, some, like me, use calendar exclusively for work, and mixing these two is a bad idea. Another thing is maintaining the list of birthdays in the calendar is tedious. That's where Birthdays Reminder can help. Maybe I should add an option to provide iCalendar endpoint (for Google Calendar, Apple Calendar Outlook, etc.) that can be used as the source of birthdays ?
@camille_vj :-3
@gaurav_shrishrimal ?
@janerette I hope my product will solve this problem if it‚Äôs still actual for you. I didn't know that LinkedIn has similar functionality, I'll take look and maybe add a new importing option.
@ferid_movsumov sure! Let me check the logs and I'll message you in DM.
Honestly, I'm not sure. I'm not a big fan of Chrome extensions (although I use selected few) because they have too much control over the browser. I hear too often stories about extensions spying on users or stealing their data. It just doesn't fit my narrative. A desktop or mobile app would be a better option, but that's a different story. Also, why would you open Chrome if you don't have an internet connection? ?

My name is Arthur and I'm a Software Engineer.

I wanted to create an app for myself that could track my location and respect my privacy.

Say hello to ‚ÄúLocation Diary‚Äù, an app which allows you to save your location and display your history on a map.

All the data is end-to-end encrypted using Blockstack, so only you can read your data.

Next, I'd like to add a mobile app to update your location automatically and an import features for people already using a similar service.

Let me know what you think! ?

It‚Äôs an end-to-end solution for all your image related needs. Free tier includes 1 GB bandwidth and unlimited number of image processing every month for 1 year.;3;-1;True;False;False;Medium;Short;No;No;Image resize-as-a-service;Short;No;No;No;No;0;No;No;No;876251;Vip Sitaraman;Yes;Yes;Low;Few;Yes;998681;Aditya Patadia;Yes;No;Low;Yes;"Hello PH,
We have been helping companies at all scales to manage their images infrastructure for the last few months. Really excited to be hunted on ProductHunt! Thanks, Vip Sitaraman.

Whether it is e-commerce, travel, fashion websites or content blogs, good quality images add to a great user experience, improve customer retention and drive up sales. But, good quality images come at a cost i.e. their huge size. Heavy images on a slow network can destroy the entire experience and impact your revenues.

Gumlet was built with the aim to make image optimisation and transformation as simple as adding one line of javascript while making it cheaper for anyone to use it.

Our pricing plan is very simple. We charge $0.1 per GB of bandwidth consumed. This comes with all features enabled right from start and there is no minimum monthly amount that needs to be paid. You always pay only for what you use.

You can store images in any storage of your choice like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, DigitalOcean Spaces or even simple web server. No matter what storage backend you use, you can be sure of lightning fast image delivery.

With Gumlet, you get features like 

- Automatic image optimisation
- Real-time URL query parameter based resizing, cropping and other transformations
- Smart cropping that automatically focuses on the most important part of an image
- GIF optimisation and resize
- SVG image optimisations
- 3 global image processing facilities - Singapore, Frankfurt and San Francisco
- Automatic WebP support
- Automatic PNG image optimisation. 
- CloudFront CDN (can be integrated with your existing CDN as well)

All you need to do is to signup and setup image source. Once it's setup, you can include our Javascript in <head> section of your application and voila! Optimised images start to appear for all your users. Our documentation can be found here: https://docs.gumlet.com/

Do try out the product and share your feedback with us! It's easy to just signup and we give 1 GB free usage every month for first 12 month so feel free to try it.

Look forward to your feedback! Cheers!
@misir Thanks a lot Misir. We would love to know about your story with Gumlet and how the product helps you.";5;-3;True;True;False;community

- We start with ear training/pronunciation so that your new vocab stops sounding foreign and you can actually remember words
- Then we guide you in a process of connecting words to images that you choose yourself, because images are substantially more memorable (and useful) than translations, and also because you get a *lot* more out of images that you've chosen when compared to images that someone else has chosen for you.
- Eventually we move you into learning new words in the context of sentences. Here, too, we guide you through choosing the words you care about, the sentences you like the most, and the images you want to use, so that everything is customized to you. Everything's much more memorable that way.
- Throughout, we take the choices you've made and quiz you on them using Spaced Repetition, so that you can efficiently get this stuff into your long term memory.
@pavlos1944 Yup - because every flashcard is customized to each user, you need to have an account (otherwise we wouldn't be able to store your choices and they'd vanish if you switched phones or reinstalled the app).

@yosun Hi, 

It's not really a Google competitor, I've dared the 'Google' comparison because in my opinion Google is THE company which change the world, and that's what we aim. Currently released apps are just an implementation detail.

Currently not built using serverless because we have great objections regarding the sustainability of this paradigm, and the Rust language allow us to have very good performance in the Backend.

Analytics is not planned (there is already a lot of existing solution, and we are not comfortable with all the privacy implications of such product).

Regarding emails, it has been a extremely well requested feature, so there great chances that it will be added to the roadmap, even if it's hard to do it well and securely (IMAP, POP...)
@dailen Hi, Thank your for the encouragements!

Search is not planned, a DDG integration would be nice, but I'm not sure if they have an API to allow that, I will take a look.
