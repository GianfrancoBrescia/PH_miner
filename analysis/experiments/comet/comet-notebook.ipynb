    "The main goal of this research is to understand what factors drive to successful app \n",
    "launching on Product Hunt (PH), where *success* is defined as whether a product is \n",
    "featured among the daily popular on the PH homepage. Popular app are upvoted by \n",
    "community members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Products are discovered by a 'hunter' on PH, a community members who scavenge the Internet\n",
    "seeking new applications. Sometimes the hunter is also one of the app 'makers' who want\n",
    "to launch and advertise a new product -- as being featured among the PH's daily popular\n",
    "represent a considerable boost in visibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "PH has compiled a set of publicly available [guidelines](?) for successful launches, yet we do \n",
    "not know whether these rules are implemented by community members and, in case, if they work.\n",

    "the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the score is left-censored (bounded by zero) counter, the most suitable approach \n",
    "appears to build a count data model, as these models have a dependent variable that is \n",
    "counts (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on).\n",

    "* *Time*, when the product is hunted/launched (posted, from now on); as the homepage is \n",

    "Tuesdays. \n",
    "* *Presentation quality*, which is achieved in different ways such as using a short, catchy \n",
    "tagline, using animated GIFs, YouTube videos, and emoji. Also the length of textual description \n",
    "may have an effect, as guidelines recommend to be specific. \n",
    "* *Sentiment (or affect)*, as in the positive, negative, neutral orientation conveyed by the textual\n",
    "description of the tool, which may or may not affect the number of upvotes received (i.e., score).\n",
    "* *Nurturing*, or whether the maker engages in the discussion with the other members who \n",
